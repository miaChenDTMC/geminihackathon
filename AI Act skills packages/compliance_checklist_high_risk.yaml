# Notes and Guidance
implementation_notes: |
  COMPLIANCE TIMELINE GUIDANCE:
  - Prohibited AI practices: Effective from 2 February 2025
  - High-risk AI systems: Phased implementation Aug 2026 - Aug 2027
  - Existing systems may have transition periods until Aug 2030

  PRIORITY GUIDANCE:
  - Critical: Must be completed for conformity - compliance blockers
  - High: Important for compliance and best practice
  - Medium: Supporting activities and documentation

  STATUS DEFINITIONS:
  - pending: Not started
  - in_progress: Work underway
  - completed: Finished with evidence
  - not_applicable: Does not apply to this system

  EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:
  - Document all evidence locations (file paths, document IDs, etc.)
  - Include completion dates for audit trail
  - Add notes explaining approach or deviations

  RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
  1. Complete critical tasks first (Articles 9-15)
  2. Build technical documentation as you implement
  3. Establish quality/governance processes early
  4. Plan conformity assessment timeline
  5. Budget 6-24 months for full implementation
