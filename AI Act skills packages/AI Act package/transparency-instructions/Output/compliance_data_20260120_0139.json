  "intended_purpose": "The ArrhythmiaDetector (v2.1.0) is a software medical device intended to assist qualified cardiologists in the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia by analyzing 12-lead ECG signal data and calculating a risk score.",
  "intended_purpose_ref": "Clinical Evaluation Report CER-2024-AD-001",
  "target_audience": "Qualified Cardiologists and trained Medical Technicians (under supervision)",
  "accuracy_metrics": "Sensitivity: 0.95 (95%) on standard test sets. The system requires a minimum of 100 data points per inference.",
  "accuracy_ref": "Validation Report VAL-AD-2.1.0 (Annex B)",
  "robustness_level": "The system includes outlier rejection and signal-to-noise validation algorithms capable of handling input noise variance up to 10%.",
  "robustness_ref": "Technical Documentation File TF-ROBUST-04",
  "cybersecurity_level": "High. Data at rest is encrypted using AES-256; data in transit uses TLS 1.3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enforced for access.",
  "cybersecurity_ref": "Security Configuration Document SEC-YAML-2024",
  "circumstances_performance": "Performance accuracy is significantly reduced in high-noise environments (e.g., during active patient movement) or if the signal variance exceeds 10%.",
  "foreseeable_misuse": "Use on pediatric patients (under 18 years old); Reliance on the AI prediction as a final diagnosis without cardiologist review; Use of non-FDA approved ECG capture hardware.",
  "misuse_mitigation": "The system is explicitly contraindicated for pediatric use in the labelling. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts 'technician' roles to maintenance only, preventing diagnostic sign-off.",
  "risks_health_safety": "Risk of false negatives (missed arrhythmia) or false positives (unnecessary medical intervention).",
  "risks_mitigation": "The system mandates manual review for any prediction with a confidence score below 80%. The AI output is a decision-support aid, not a standalone diagnostic.",
  "input_specifications": "12-lead ECG data in array format (float values, millivolts). Minimum 100 data points required per sequence. Must be captured via FDA-approved ECG hardware.",
  "limitations_explainability": "The risk score is a statistical aggregation (mean of filtered data) and does not isolate specific morphological waveforms for the user.",
  "explainability_mitigation": "Users must verify the risk score against the visual representation of the raw ECG signal provided by the capture device.",
  "human_oversight": "Cardiologists must review all positive findings and any result where system confidence is <80%. Final diagnostic decision rests with the human operator.",
  "oversight_freq": "Per inference event.",
  "lifecycle_changes": "Monthly calibration checks and regular security patching.",
  "expected_lifetime": "3 years",
  "lifetime_trigger": "Hardware degradation or expiration of the 3-year validated operational window.",
  "maintenance_measures": "Automated monthly calibration checks (`run_maintenance_check`) and monthly vulnerability patching.",
  "maintenance_freq": "Monthly (Every 30 days)",
  "software_updates": "Security patches applied monthly; Bi-annual penetration testing remediation.",
  "update_freq": "Monthly",
  "computational_resources": "16GB RAM, NVIDIA GPU with minimum 8GB VRAM.",
  "hardware_resources": "FDA-approved ECG capture device.",
  "logging_collection": "Automated system logging via Python logging module capturing User, Action, Patient ID (pseudonymized), Prediction, and Confidence.",
  "logging_collection_ref": "/var/log/secure_ai_logs/",
  "logging_storage": "Secure local storage with daily rotation, retained for 365 days. Protected by SHA-256 integrity checks.",
  "logging_interpretation": "Logs contain 'Conf' (Confidence) values. A confidence value < 0.80 indicates the inference was flagged for mandatory manual review."
