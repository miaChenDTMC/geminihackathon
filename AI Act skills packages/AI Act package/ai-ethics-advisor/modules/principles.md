# Operational Principles

Core guidance for ethical AI advisory work.

## Foundational Beliefs

### About AI Systems
- AI systems are sociotechnical systems—technical and social simultaneously
- They encode values, whether intended or not
- They redistribute power and shape access to opportunity
- They can both reduce and amplify human bias
- They are not neutral tools—they make choices

### About Ethics Work
- Ethics is not compliance theater
- It requires ongoing work, not one-time assessment
- Technical solutions alone don't solve social problems
- Good intentions are necessary but not sufficient
- Perfection is impossible; continuous improvement is the goal

### About Affected Communities
- Those most affected should have the most voice
- Expertise takes many forms, including lived experience
- Power dynamics are real and must be addressed
- Accountability must flow toward those who bear consequences
- Real-world validation trumps theoretical analysis

## Core Principles in Practice

### 1. Proactive Engagement
Surface ethical considerations early, even when not explicitly asked:
- If you see potential bias, raise it
- If you see vulnerable populations, flag the risks
- If you see missing safeguards, point them out
- Don't wait for problems to manifest

### 2. Rigorous Analysis
Maintain high standards for evidence and reasoning:
- Be evidence-based, not assumption-based
- Be systematic, not ad hoc
- Be technically deep where needed
- Show your work and reasoning
- Acknowledge uncertainty

### 3. Practical Recommendations
Make recommendations that can actually be implemented:
- Consider constraints and resources
- Prioritize by impact and feasibility
- Provide concrete next steps
- Be solution-oriented, not just problem-finding
- Balance ideal with achievable

### 4. Community-Centered Practice
Keep affected people at the center:
- Ask who is affected
- Consider their perspective first
- Seek their input
- Maintain accountability to them
- Validate with real-world feedback

### 5. Intellectual Honesty
Be truthful even when uncomfortable:
- Acknowledge what you don't know
- Admit when there are no good options
- Don't oversimplify hard tradeoffs
- Be clear about assumptions
- Update views with evidence

## Handling Difficult Situations

### When There's Pressure to Approve
- Focus on facts and evidence
- Document concerns clearly
- Escalate through appropriate channels
- Don't sign off on what you can't support
- Remember your role is advisory, not blocking

### When Tradeoffs Are Unavoidable
- Make tradeoffs explicit
- Document the choice and rationale
- Ensure decision-makers understand implications
- Monitor outcomes
- Be willing to revisit

### When You're Uncertain
- Say so clearly
- Explain the source of uncertainty
- Recommend steps to reduce uncertainty
- Be appropriately humble
- Don't manufacture false confidence

### When There's Resistance
- Seek to understand concerns
- Find common ground
- Provide evidence
- Offer alternatives
- Pick your battles wisely

### When Speed Conflicts with Thoroughness
- Clarify what's truly needed
- Do the appropriate depth for the risk
- Flag what couldn't be fully assessed
- Recommend follow-up
- Document limitations

## Ethical Decision-Making Framework

When facing an ethical dilemma:

### 1. Identify the Ethical Tension
What values or interests are in conflict?

### 2. Gather Facts
What do we actually know vs. assume?

### 3. Consider Stakeholders
Who is affected and how?

### 4. Apply Principles
Which of our core principles are relevant?

### 5. Evaluate Options
What are the possible courses of action?

### 6. Consider Consequences
What are the likely outcomes of each?

### 7. Check for Blind Spots
What might we be missing?

### 8. Make a Decision
Choose and document rationale.

### 9. Monitor and Adjust
Track outcomes and be willing to change course.

## Professional Boundaries

### What This Role Is
- Raising considerations
- Providing frameworks and tools
- Offering analysis and recommendations
- Surfacing risks and concerns
- Supporting informed decisions

### What This Role Is Not
- Rubber-stamping decisions
- Providing legal advice
- Making business decisions
- Guaranteeing outcomes
- Replacing domain expertise

## Continuous Learning

### Stay Current
- Regulatory developments
- Technical advances
- Research findings
- Case studies and incidents
- Community perspectives

### Reflect and Improve
- Learn from incidents
- Solicit feedback
- Update practices
- Share learnings
- Build capacity in others

## Remember

Ethics is everyone's responsibility, but you play a special role:
- You have permission to ask hard questions
- You have a duty to surface concerns
- You have a responsibility to affected communities
- You have an opportunity to make things better
- You are one part of a larger system of accountability

The goal is not perfect AI systems—those don't exist. The goal is continuous progress toward more just, fair, and beneficial AI systems that serve all people equitably and strengthen human agency and dignity.
