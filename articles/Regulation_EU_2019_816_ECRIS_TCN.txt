REGULATION (EU) 2019/816 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 17 April 2019

establishing a centralised system for the identification of Member States holding conviction information on third-country nationals and stateless persons (ECRIS-TCN) to supplement the European Criminal Records Information System and amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1726

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 82(1), second subparagraph, point (d) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure

(

1

)

,

Whereas:

(1)

The Union has set itself the objective of offering its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice without internal frontiers, in which the free movement of persons is ensured. That objective should be achieved by means of, among others, appropriate measures to prevent and combat crime, including organised crime and terrorism.

(2)

That objective requires that information on convictions handed down in the Member States be taken into account outside the convicting Member State in the course of new criminal proceedings, as laid down in Council Framework Decision 2008/675/JHA

(

2

)

, as well as in order to prevent new offences.

(3)

That objective presupposes the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between the competent authorities of the Member States. Such an exchange of information is organised and facilitated by the rules set out in Council Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA

(

3

)

and by the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS), established by Council Decision 2009/316/JHA

(

4

)

.

(4)

The existing ECRIS legal framework, however, does not sufficiently address the particularities of requests concerning third-country nationals. Although it is already possible to exchange information on third-country nationals through ECRIS, there is no common Union procedure or mechanism in place to do so efficiently, rapidly and accurately.

(5)

Within the Union, information on third-country nationals is not gathered as it is for nationals of Member States — in the Member States of nationality — but only stored in the Member States where the convictions have been handed down. A complete overview of the criminal history of a third-country national can therefore be ascertained only if such information is requested from all Member States.

(6)

Such ‘blanket requests’ impose a disproportionate administrative burden on all Member States, including those not holding information on the particular third-country national. In practice, that burden deters Member States from requesting information on third-country nationals from other Member States, which seriously hinders the exchange of information between them, limiting their access to criminal records information to information stored in their national register. As a consequence, the risk of information exchange between Member States being inefficient and incomplete is increased, which in turn affects the level of security and safety provided to citizens and persons residing within the Union.

(7)

To improve the situation, a system should be established by which the central authority of a Member State can find out promptly and efficiently which other Member States hold criminal records information on a third-country national (‘ECRIS-TCN’). The existing ECRIS framework could then be used to request the criminal records information from those Member States in accordance with Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA.

(8)

This Regulation should therefore lay down rules establishing a centralised system at the Union level containing personal data, and rules on the division of responsibilities between the Member State and the organisation responsible for the development and maintenance of the centralised system, as well as any specific data protection provisions needed to supplement the existing data protection arrangements and to provide for an adequate overall level of data protection, data security and protection of the fundamental rights of the persons concerned.

(9)

The objective of offering to citizens of the Union an area of freedom, security and justice without internal frontiers, in which the free movement of persons is ensured, also requires complete information to be held on convictions of citizens of the Union who also hold the nationality of a third country. Given the possibility that those persons could present themselves as holding one or several nationalities, and that different convictions could be stored in the convicting Member State or in the Member State of nationality, it is necessary to include citizens of the Union who also hold the nationality of a third country within the scope of this Regulation. The exclusion of such persons would result in the information stored in ECRIS-TCN being incomplete. That would jeopardise the reliability of the system. However, since such persons hold Union citizenship, the conditions under which fingerprint data can be included in ECRIS-TCN in respect of those persons should be comparable to the conditions under which the fingerprint data of Union citizens are exchanged between Member States through ECRIS, which was established by Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA and Decision 2009/316/JHA. Therefore, in respect of citizens of the Union who also hold the nationality of a third country, fingerprint data should only be included in ECRIS-TCN where they have been collected in accordance with national law during criminal proceedings, it being understood that for such inclusion Member States should be able to use fingerprint data collected for purposes other than criminal proceedings, where such use is permitted under national law.

(10)

ECRIS-TCN should allow for processing of fingerprint data for the purpose of identifying the Member States in possession of criminal records information on a third-country national. It should also allow for processing of facial images in order to confirm his or her identity. It is essential that the entry and use of fingerprint data and facial images not exceed what is strictly necessary to achieve the aim, respect fundamental rights, as well as the best interests of children, and be in conformity with applicable Union data protection rules.

(11)

The European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) established by Regulation (EU) 2018/1726 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

5

)

should be entrusted with the task of developing and operating ECRIS-TCN, given its experience with managing other large scale systems in the area of justice and home affairs. Its mandate should be amended to reflect those new tasks.

(12)

eu-LISA should be equipped with the appropriate funding and staffing to meet its responsibilities under this Regulation.

(13)

Given the need to create close technical links between ECRIS-TCN and ECRIS, eu-LISA should also be entrusted with the task of further developing and maintaining the ECRIS reference implementation, and its mandate should be amended to reflect this.

(14)

Four Member States have developed their own national ECRIS implementation software in accordance with Decision 2009/316/JHA, and have been using it instead of the ECRIS reference implementation to exchange criminal records information. Given the particular features that those Member States have introduced in their systems for national use and the investments that they have made, they should be allowed to use their national ECRIS implementation software for the purposes of ECRIS-TCN as well, provided that the conditions set out in this Regulation are met.

(15)

ECRIS-TCN should contain only the identity information of third-country nationals convicted by a criminal court within the Union. Such identity information should include alphanumeric and fingerprint data. It should also be possible for facial images to be included in as far as the law of the Member State where a conviction is handed down allows for the collection and storage of facial images of a convicted person.

(16)

The alphanumeric data to be entered by the Member States into the central system should include the surname (family name) and the first names (given names) of the convicted person, as well as, where such information is available to the central authority, any pseudonyms or aliases of that person. If differing personal data, such as a different spelling of a name in another alphabet, are known to the Member State concerned, it should be possible to enter such data into the central system as additional information.

(17)

The alphanumeric data should also include, as additional information, the identity number, or the type and number of the person's identification documents, as well as the name of the authority issuing those documents, where such information is available to the central authority. The Member State should seek to verify the authenticity of identification documents before entering the relevant information in the central system. In any case, given that such information could be unreliable, it should be used cautiously.

(18)

The central authorities should use ECRIS-TCN to identify the Member States holding criminal records information on a third-country national when criminal records information on that person is requested in the Member State concerned for the purposes of criminal proceedings against that person, or for the purposes referred to in this Regulation. While ECRIS-TCN should in principle be used in all such cases, the authority responsible for conducting the criminal proceedings should be able to decide that ECRIS-TCN should not be used when it would not be appropriate in the circumstances of the case, e.g. in certain types of urgent criminal proceedings, in cases of transit, when criminal records information has recently been obtained via ECRIS, or in respect of minor offences, in particular minor traffic offences, minor offences in relation to general municipal regulations and minor public order offences.

(19)

Member States should also be able to use ECRIS-TCN for purposes other than those set out in this Regulation, if provided for under and in accordance with national law. However, in order to enhance the transparency of the use of ECRIS-TCN, Member States should notify such other purposes to the Commission, which should ensure publication of all the notifications in the

Official Journal of the European Union

.

(20)

It should also be possible for other authorities requesting criminal records information to decide that ECRIS-TCN should not be used when this would not be appropriate in the circumstances of the case, e.g. when certain standard administrative checks need to be carried out regarding the professional qualifications of a person, especially if it is known that criminal records information will not be requested from other Member States, irrespective of the result of the search in ECRIS-TCN. However, ECRIS-TCN should always be used when the request for criminal records information has been initiated by a person who asks for information on his or her own criminal record in accordance with Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA, or when it is made in order to obtain criminal records information in accordance with Directive 2011/93/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

6

)

.

(21)

Third-country nationals should have the right to obtain information in writing concerning their own criminal record in accordance with the law of the Member State where they request such information to be provided and in accordance with Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA. Before providing such information to a third-country national, the Member State concerned should query ECRIS-TCN.

(22)

Citizens of the Union who also hold the nationality of a third country will only be included in ECRIS-TCN if the competent authorities are aware that such persons hold the nationality of a third country. Where the competent authorities are not aware that citizens of the Union also hold the nationality of a third country, it is nevertheless possible that such persons have prior convictions as third-country nationals. In order to ensure that the competent authorities have a complete overview of criminal records, it should be possible to query ECRIS-TCN to verify whether, in respect of a citizen of the Union, any Member State holds criminal record information concerning this person as a third-country national.

(23)

In the event that there is a match between data recorded in the central system and those used for search by a Member State (hit), the identity information against which a hit was recorded should be provided together with the hit. The result of a search should be used by the central authorities only for the purpose of making a request through ECRIS or by the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) established by Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

7

)

, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) established by Regulation (EU) 2016/794 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

8

)

, and the European Public Prosecutor's Office (the ‘EPPO’) established by Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939

(

9

)

, only for the purpose of making a request for conviction information as referred to in this Regulation.

(24)

In the first instance, facial images included in ECRIS-TCN should only be used for the purpose of confirming the identity of a third-country national in order to identify the Member States holding information on previous convictions of that third-country national. In the future, it should be possible for facial images to be used for automated biometric matching, provided that the technical and policy requirements to do so have been met. The Commission, taking into account necessity and proportionality, as well as the technical developments in the field of facial recognition software, should assess the availability and readiness of the required technology before adopting a delegated act concerning the use of facial images for the purpose of identifying third-country nationals in order to identify the Member States holding information on previous convictions concerning those persons.

(25)

The use of biometrics is necessary as it is the most reliable method of identifying third-country nationals within the territory of the Member States, who are often not in possession of documents or any other means of identification, as well as for more reliable matching of third-country nationals' data.

(26)

Member States should enter in the central system fingerprint data of convicted third-country nationals that have been collected in accordance with national law during criminal proceedings. In order to have as complete identity information as possible available in the central system, Member States should also be able to enter into the central system fingerprint data that have been collected for other purposes than criminal proceedings, where those fingerprint data are available for use in criminal proceedings in compliance with national law.

(27)

This Regulation should establish minimum criteria as regards the fingerprint data that Member States should include in the central system. Member States should be given the choice either to enter the fingerprint data of third-country nationals who have received a custodial sentence of at least 6 months, or to enter the fingerprint data of third-country nationals who have been convicted of a criminal offence which is punishable under the law of the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence of a maximum period of at least 12 months.

(28)

Member States should create records in ECRIS-TCN regarding convicted third-country nationals. This should, where possible, be done automatically and without undue delay after their conviction was entered into the national criminal records. Member States should, in accordance with this Regulation, enter into the central system alphanumeric and fingerprint data relating to convictions handed down after the date of the start of entry of data into the ECRIS-TCN. As from the same date, and any time thereafter, Member States should be able to enter facial images in the central system.

(29)

Member States should also, in accordance with this Regulation, create records in ECRIS-TCN regarding third-country nationals convicted prior to the date of start of entry of data, in order to ensure the maximum effectiveness of the system. However, for that purpose Member States should not be obliged to collect information which is not already in their criminal records prior to the date of start of entry of data. The fingerprint data of third-country nationals collected in connection with such prior convictions should be included only where they have been collected during criminal proceedings, and where the Member State concerned considers that they can be clearly matched with other identity information in criminal records.

(30)

Improving the exchange of information on convictions should assist Member States in their implementation of Framework Decision 2008/675/JHA, which obliges the Member States to take account of previous convictions in other Member States in the course of new criminal proceedings to the extent that previous national convictions are taken into account under national law.

(31)

A hit indicated by ECRIS-TCN should not of itself be taken to mean that the third-country national concerned has been convicted in the Member States that are indicated. The existence of previous convictions should only be confirmed based on information received from the criminal records of the Member States concerned.

(32)

Notwithstanding the possibility of using the Union's financial programmes in accordance with the applicable rules, each Member State should bear its own costs arising from the implementation, administration, use and maintenance of its criminal records database and national fingerprints databases, and from the implementation, administration, use and maintenance of the technical alterations necessary to be able to use ECRIS-TCN, including their connections to the national central access point.

(33)

Eurojust, Europol and the EPPO should have access to ECRIS-TCN for the purpose of identifying the Member States holding criminal records information on a third-country national in order to support their statutory tasks. Eurojust should also have direct access to ECRIS-TCN for the purpose of carrying out its task under this Regulation of acting as a contact point for third countries and international organisations, without prejudice to the application of principles of judicial cooperation in criminal matters, including rules on mutual legal assistance. While the position of Member States who are not part of the enhanced cooperation on the establishment of the EPPO should be taken into account, the EPPO should not be refused access to conviction information on the sole ground that the Member State concerned is not part of that enhanced cooperation.

(34)

This Regulation establishes strict rules on access to ECRIS-TCN and the necessary safeguards, including the responsibility of the Member States in collecting and using the data. It also sets out how individuals may exercise their rights to compensation, access, rectification, erasure and redress, in particular the right to an effective remedy and the supervision of processing operations by public independent authorities. It therefore respects fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined, in particular, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including the right to protection of personal data, the principle of equality before the law and the general prohibition of discrimination. In this regard, it also takes into account the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and other human rights obligations under international law.

(35)

Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

10

)

should apply to the processing of personal data by competent national authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security. Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

11

)

should apply to the processing of personal data by national authorities when such processing does not fall within the scope of Directive (EU) 2016/680. Coordinated supervision should be ensured in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

12

)

, which should also apply to the processing of personal data by eu-LISA.

(36)

In respect of prior convictions, the central authorities should enter alphanumeric data by the end of the period for entry of data under this Regulation, and fingerprint data within two years after the date of the start of operations of ECRIS-TCN. Member States should be able to enter all data at the same time, provided those time limits are met.

(37)

Rules should be laid down on the liability of the Member States, Eurojust, Europol, the EPPO and eu-LISA in respect of damage arising from any breach of this Regulation.

(38)

In order to improve identification of the Member States holding information on previous convictions of third-country nationals, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of supplementing this Regulation by providing for the use of facial images for the purpose of identifying third-country nationals in order to identify the Member States holding information on previous convictions. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making

(

13

)

. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.

(39)

In order to ensure uniform conditions for the establishment and operational management of ECRIS-TCN, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council

(

14

)

.

(40)

Member States should take the necessary measures to comply with this Regulation as soon as possible so as to ensure the proper functioning of ECRIS-TCN, taking into account the time that eu-LISA needs to develop and implement ECRIS-TCN. However, Member States should have at least 36 months after the entry into force of this Regulation to take measures to comply with this Regulation.

(41)

Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to enable the rapid and efficient exchange of accurate criminal records information on third-country nationals, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by putting in place common rules, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.

(42)

In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.

(43)

In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, Ireland is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.

(44)

In accordance with Article 3 and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21, the United Kingdom has notified its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.

(45)

The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

15

)

and delivered an opinion on 12 December 2017

(

16

)

,

3.   The interface software shall be integrated with the ECRIS reference implementation. The Member States shall use the ECRIS reference implementation or, in the situation and under the conditions set out in paragraphs 4 to 8, the national ECRIS implementation software to query ECRIS-TCN and to send subsequent requests for criminal records information.

4.   The Member States which use their national ECRIS implementation software shall be responsible for ensuring that their national ECRIS implementation software allows their national criminal records authorities to use ECRIS-TCN, with the exception of the Interface Software, in accordance with this Regulation. For that purpose, they shall, before the date of start of operations of ECRIS-TCN in accordance with Article 35(4), ensure that their national ECRIS implementation software functions in accordance with the protocols and technical specifications established in the implementing acts referred to in Article 10, and with any further technical requirements established by eu-LISA pursuant to this Regulation based on those implementing acts.

5.   For as long as they do not use the ECRIS reference implementation, Member States which use their national ECRIS implementation software shall also ensure the implementation of any subsequent technical adaptations to their national ECRIS implementation software required by any changes to the technical specifications established in the implementing acts referred to in Article 10, or changes to any further technical requirements established by eu-LISA pursuant to this Regulation based on those implementing acts, without undue delay.

6.   The Member States which use their national ECRIS implementation software shall bear all the costs associated with the implementation, maintenance and further development of their national ECRIS implementation software and its interconnection with ECRIS-TCN, with the exception of the interface software.

7.   If a Member State which uses its national ECRIS implementation software is unable to comply with its obligations under this Article, it shall be obliged to use the ECRIS reference implementation, including the integrated interface software, to make use of ECRIS-TCN.

8.   In view of the assessment to be carried out by the Commission pursuant to point (b) of Article 36(10), the Member States concerned shall provide the Commission with all necessary information.

CHAPTER II

Entry and use of data by central authorities

Article 5

Data entry in ECRIS-TCN

1.   For each convicted third-country national, the central authority of the convicting Member State shall create a data record in the central system. The data record shall include:

(a)

as concerns alphanumeric data:

(i)

information to be included unless, in individual cases, such information is not known to the central authority (obligatory information):

—

surname (family name),

—

first names (given names),

—

date of birth,

—

place of birth (town and country),

—

nationality or nationalities,

—

gender,

—

previous names, if applicable,

—

the code of the convicting Member State,

(ii)

information to be included if it has been entered in the criminal record (optional information):

—

parents' names,

(iii)

information to be included if it is available to the central authority (additional information):

—

identity number, or the type and number of the person's identification documents, as well as the name of the issuing authority,

—

pseudonyms or aliases;

(b)

as concerns fingerprint data:

(i)

fingerprint data that have been collected in accordance with national law during criminal proceedings;

(ii)

as a minimum, fingerprint data collected on the basis of either of the following criteria:

—

where the third-country national has received a custodial sentence of at least 6 months;

or

—

where the third-country national has been convicted of a criminal offence which is punishable under the law of the Member State by a custodial sentence of a maximum period of at least 12 months.

2.   The fingerprint data referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article shall have the technical specifications for the quality, resolution and processing of fingerprint data provided for in the implementing act referred to in point (b) of Article 10(1). The reference number of the fingerprint data of the convicted person shall include the code of the convicting Member State.

3.   The data record may also contain facial images of the convicted third-country national, if the law of the convicting Member State allows for the collection and storage of facial images of convicted persons.

4.   The convicting Member State shall create the data record automatically, where possible, and without undue delay after the conviction has been entered into the criminal records.

5.   The convicting Member States shall also create data records for convictions handed down prior to the date of start of entry of data in accordance with Article 35(1) to the extent that data related to convicted persons are stored in their national databases. In those cases, fingerprint data shall be included only where they have been collected during criminal proceedings in accordance with national law, and where they can be clearly matched with other identity information in criminal records.

6.   In order to comply with the obligations set out in points (b)(i) and (ii) of paragraph 1, and in paragraph 5, Member States may use fingerprint data collected for purposes other than criminal proceedings, where such use is permitted under national law.

Article 6

Facial images

1.   Until the entry into force of the delegated act provided for in paragraph 2, facial images may be used only to confirm the identity of a third-country national who has been identified as a result of an alphanumeric search or a search using fingerprint data.

2.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 37 supplementing this Regulation concerning the use of facial images for the purpose of identifying third-country nationals in order to identify the Member States holding information on previous convictions concerning such persons, when it becomes technically possible. Before exercising this empowerment, the Commission, taking into account necessity and proportionality, as well as technical developments in the field of facial recognition software, shall assess the availability and readiness of the required technology.

Article 7

Use of ECRIS-TCN for identifying the Member States holding criminal records information

1.   The central authorities shall use ECRIS-TCN to identify the Member States holding criminal records information on a third-country national in order to obtain information on previous convictions through ECRIS, when criminal records information on that person is requested in the Member State concerned for the purposes of criminal proceedings against that person, or for any of the following purposes, if provided for under and in accordance with national law:

—

checking a person's own criminal record at his or her request,

—

security clearance,

—

obtaining a licence or permit,

—

employment vetting,

—

vetting for voluntary activities involving direct and regular contacts with children or vulnerable persons,

—

visa, acquisition of citizenship and migration procedures, including asylum procedures, and

9.   Four years after the start of operations of ECRIS-TCN and every four years thereafter, the Commission shall conduct an overall evaluation of ECRIS-TCN and of the ECRIS reference implementation. The overall evaluation report established on this basis shall include an assessment of the application of this Regulation and an examination of results that have been achieved relative to the objectives that were set and of the impact on fundamental rights. The report shall also include an assessment of whether the underlying rationale for operating ECRIS-TCN continues to hold, of the appropriateness of the use of biometric data for the purposes of ECRIS-TCN, of the security of ECRIS-TCN and of any security implications for future operations. The evaluation shall include any necessary recommendations. The Commission shall transmit the report to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Data Protection Supervisor and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.

10.   In addition, the first overall evaluation as referred to in paragraph 9 shall include an assessment of:
