REGULATION (EU) 2018/858 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 30 May 2018

on the approval and market surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, amending Regulations (EC) No 715/2007 and (EC) No 595/2009 and repealing Directive 2007/46/EC

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee

(

1

)

,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure

(

2

)

,

Whereas:

(1)

In accordance with Article 26(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is to be ensured. Internal market rules should be transparent, simple, consistent and effective, thereby providing legal certainty and clarity for the benefit of businesses and consumers.

(2)

To that end, a comprehensive EU framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of the systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, was established by Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

3

)

.

(3)

In 2013, the Commission carried out an assessment of the Union legal framework for the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles which showed that the framework established by Directive 2007/46/EC is appropriate for achieving the main goals of harmonisation, effective functioning of the internal market and fair competition, and concluded that it should therefore continue to apply.

(4)

That assessment also concluded, however, that there is a need to introduce market surveillance provisions to complement the type-approval requirements; a need to clarify the recall and safeguard procedures, as well as the conditions for granting extensions to approvals for existing types of vehicle; a need to improve the enforcement of the framework for type-approval by harmonising and enhancing the type-approval procedures and conformity of production procedures applied by Member States' authorities and technical services; a need to clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities of economic operators in the supply chain, and of the authorities and parties involved in the enforcement of the framework, guaranteeing the independence of those authorities and parties, and preventing conflicts of interest; and a need to improve the suitability of alternative approval schemes (national small series and individual vehicle approvals) and the suitability of the multi-stage type-approval process to provide appropriate flexibility for niche markets and small and medium-sized enterprises without, however, distorting the level playing field.

(5)

In addition, recent problems with the implementation of the framework for EU type-approval have revealed particular weaknesses and have demonstrated the need for its fundamental revision in order to ensure that it is robust, transparent, predictable and sustainable and that it provides a high level of safety and of health and environmental protection.

(6)

This Regulation introduces a number of safeguards to prevent requirements imposed in the process of granting approval to vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units from being misapplied. In order to prevent abuse of the approval process in the future, it is important that those safeguards are effective.

(7)

This Regulation lays down harmonised rules and principles for the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, and for individual vehicle approval, with a view to ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market for the benefit of businesses and consumers and in order to offer a high level of safety and of health and environmental protection.

(8)

This Regulation lays down the technical and administrative type-approval requirements for motor vehicles for the carriage of passengers (category M), and motor vehicles for the carriage of goods (category N) and their trailers (category O), and for the systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles with a view to ensuring a high level of safety and of environmental performance.

(9)

National authorities should apply and enforce the requirements of this Regulation in a uniform manner across the Union to ensure a level playing field and to avoid divergent standards being applied across the Union. They should fully cooperate with the Forum for Exchange of Information on Enforcement (‘the Forum’) and with the Commission in its audit and oversight activities.

(10)

This Regulation should strengthen the current framework for EU type-approval, in particular through the introduction of provisions on market surveillance. Market surveillance in the automotive sector should be introduced by specifying the obligations of the economic operators in the supply chain, the responsibilities of the enforcement authorities in the Member States, and the measures to be taken when automotive products are encountered on the market that represent serious safety or environmental risks, that undermine the protection of consumers, or that do not comply with the type-approval requirements.

(11)

In order to ensure an effective implementation of the type-approval requirements, the current provisions on conformity of production should be enhanced by,

inter alia

, providing for mandatory periodic audits of the conformity control methods and of the continued conformity of the automotive products concerned and, by reinforcing the requirements relating to the competence, obligations and performance of the technical services that carry out tests for whole-vehicle type-approval under the responsibility of approval authorities. The proper functioning of technical services is crucial for ensuring a high level of safety and of environmental protection and citizens' confidence in the system. The criteria for designation of technical services provided by Directive 2007/46/EC should be laid down in this Regulation in greater detail in order to ensure that they are applied consistently in all Member States. The assessment methods of the technical services in Member States have a tendency to differ progressively due to the increased complexity of their work. Therefore, it is necessary to provide for procedural obligations that ensure an exchange of information, and monitoring of Member States' practices for, the assessment, designation, notification and monitoring of their technical services. Those procedural obligations should remove any existing discrepancies in the methods used by, and in the interpretation of the criteria for the designation of, technical services. In order to ensure adequate oversight and a level playing-field across the Union, the assessment of an applicant technical service should include an on-site assessment.

(12)

In the case of multi-stage type-approvals, it is essential to verify that changes made before the final stage of completion do not affect the functioning of type-approved systems, components or separate technical units in a way that would invalidate the type-approval previously granted.

(13)

The need for control and monitoring of technical services has increased because technical progress has increased the risk of technical services not possessing the necessary competence to test new technologies or devices that emerge within their scope of designation. As technical progress shortens product cycles and as the intervals of surveillance on-site assessments and of the monitoring vary, the validity of the designation of technical services should be limited in time, which should ensure that the competence of technical services is periodically assessed.

(14)

The designation and monitoring of technical services by the Member States, in accordance with detailed and strict criteria, should therefore be subject to supervisory controls,

inter alia

as a condition for the renewal of their designation. The position of technical services vis-à-vis manufacturers should be strengthened, including their right and duty to carry out unannounced factory inspections and to conduct physical or laboratory tests on automotive products covered by this Regulation, in order to ensure continuous compliance by manufacturers after they have obtained a type-approval for their automotive products.

(15)

In order to increase transparency and mutual trust and to further align and develop the criteria for the assessment, designation, and notification of technical services, as well as extension and renewal procedures, Member States should cooperate with each other and with the Commission. Member States should consult each other and the Commission on questions with general relevance for the implementation of this Regulation and inform each other and the Commission. It is important that the Member States and the Commission use a common secure electronic exchange system as a means to facilitate and enhance administrative cooperation after appropriate implementation periods in order to make managing the exchange of information more efficient and effective on the basis of simple and unified procedures. In order to facilitate its accessibility and transparency, information should be available as structured data that is electronically searchable.

(16)

Where designation of a technical service is based on accreditation within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

4

)

, accreditation bodies and designating approval authorities should exchange information relevant for the assessment of the competence of technical services.

(17)

The Member States should have the possibility to levy fees for the designation and monitoring of technical services in order to ensure the sustainability of the monitoring of those technical services by Member States and to establish a level playing field for technical services.

(18)

When, in spite of the measures taken by the Member States to ensure a coherent and continuing application of the requirements, the competence of a technical service is in doubt, the Commission should have the possibility to investigate individual cases.

(19)

In order to ensure that tests and reports provided by technical services are not influenced by non-legitimate circumstances, it is important that the organisation and operation of technical services ensure full impartiality and independence. To be able to carry out their tasks in a coherent and systematic manner, technical services should have in place a satisfactory management system that includes provisions on professional secrecy. In order to allow technical services to perform their work properly, their personnel should always exhibit the appropriate level of knowledge, competence and independence.

(20)

A robust compliance enforcement mechanism is necessary in order to ensure that the requirements under this Regulation are met. Ensuring compliance with the type-approval and conformity of production requirements of the legislation governing the automotive sector should remain the key responsibility of the approval authorities, as it is an obligation closely linked to the issuing of the type-approval and requires detailed knowledge of its content. It is therefore important that the performance of approval authorities is regularly verified.

(21)

In order to ensure compliance with this Regulation, to ensure its uniform application within the Union and to facilitate an exchange of best practices, the Commission should organise and carry out assessments of the procedures set up by approval authorities in accordance with this Regulation. The outcome of such assessments, including any non-binding recommendations, should be discussed within the Forum. The assessments should be carried out periodically, taking into account the principle of proportionality, the number and variety of type-approvals granted and any instances of non-compliance discovered during the compliance verification.

(22)

In order to ensure the effectiveness of the Commission's assessment while minimising the administrative burden, it is important that the approval authorities and the Commission cooperate efficiently during the assessment, in particular during the assessment at the premises of the approval authority concerned. The Commission assessments should be carried out in compliance with applicable law, complying,

inter alia

, with the working periods or language of the national authorities. The costs arising from those assessments should be borne by the Commission, including those related to document translation.

(23)

The compliance verification system is being strengthened by the recognition of a formal process of accreditation of technical services or via the introduction of regular peer-evaluation in respect of the assessment and monitoring of technical services by approval authorities. This aims to ensure that a uniform level of quality and stringency is applied by all approval authorities in enforcing the type-approval requirements.

(24)

Closer coordination between national authorities through information exchange and coordinated assessments under the direction of a coordinating authority is fundamental in order to ensure a consistently high level of safety and of health and environmental protection within the internal market. It would also lead to more efficient use of scarce resources at national level. For this purpose, an advisory Forum should be established for Member States and the Commission with the objective of promoting best practices, exchanging information and coordinating activities related to the enforcement of type-approval legislation. The currently informal cooperation between Member States in that respect would benefit from a more formal framework. The Forum should be composed of representatives appointed by the Member States representing their approval authorities and market surveillance authorities. The representatives attending a given meeting should be selected on the basis of the issues discussed by the Forum. In order to benefit from a range of views and inputs, it is useful for particular outside observers to be invited on a regular basis to the Forum, whenever those observers' activities are relevant to the issues to be discussed.

(25)

In order to avoid potential conflicts of interest, approval authorities and market surveillance authorities should not be linked when carrying out their tasks. Where a Member State chooses to place those authorities within the same organisation, it should at least ensure that that organisation has structures that ensure that the activities of the authorities remain distinct from one another in terms of their direct management and decision-making.

(26)

The rules on Union market surveillance and on the control of products entering the Union market provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 apply to motor vehicles and their trailers, as well as to systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles. Those rules do not prevent Member States from choosing the competent authorities that are to carry out those tasks. Market surveillance is a competence that may be shared between different national authorities, in order to take account of the national market surveillance systems in the Member States established under Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Effective coordination and monitoring at Union and national levels should guarantee that approval authorities and market surveillance authorities enforce the new framework for type-approval and for market surveillance.

(27)

It is necessary to include rules on market surveillance in this Regulation in order to reinforce the rights and obligations of the national authorities, to ensure effective coordination of their market surveillance activities and to clarify the applicable procedures.

(28)

It is necessary for the market surveillance authorities and the approval authorities to be able to properly perform the tasks provided for by this Regulation. Member States should, in particular, equip them with the resources necessary in order to do so.

(29)

In order to increase transparency in the approval process and to facilitate the exchange of information and the independent verification by market surveillance authorities, approval authorities and the Commission, type-approval documentation should be provided in electronic format and be made publicly available, subject to exemptions concerning the protection of commercial secrets and the protection of personal data.

(30)

The obligations of national authorities concerning market surveillance provided in this Regulation are more specific than those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. This is the result of the need to take account of the special characteristics of the framework for type-approval and the need to complement that framework with an effective market surveillance mechanism ensuring the robust verification of compliance of the automotive products covered by this Regulation. In order to ensure the functioning of the framework, it is essential that market surveillance authorities verify compliance of the automotive products irrespective of whether their type-approval was granted before or after the date of application of this Regulation.

(31)

It is essential for the proper functioning of market surveillance that the compliance of vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units on the market is verified on the basis of a robust risk-assessment. That verification of compliance, complemented by the establishment of a minimum number of checks on vehicles per year, would also contribute to the effective Union-wide implementation of the market surveillance obligations.

(32)

In view of the special characteristics of, and the potential risk linked to, emissions, an adequate share of the minimum number of checks should be allocated to emission-related tests. In order to ensure that vehicles comply fully, each single check should include verification that all the requirements for type-approval that apply to the vehicle being tested as regards emissions have been met.

(33)

It should be possible to use any tests carried out on any vehicle in any Member State for the purpose of taking corrective and restrictive measure in another Member State. The results of checks performed on vehicles within one Member State should be considered adequate for the purpose of invoking corrective and restrictive measures in another Member State. The physical transportation of the vehicles concerned should not, therefore, be necessary for the purpose of any checks which are carried out on behalf of another Member State.

(34)

It is of particular importance that national authorities and the Commission consider in-service conformity testing and inspections of vehicles to be part of their compliance verification procedures. The selection of the vehicles that are to be subject to that compliance verification should be based on an appropriate risk assessment which takes account of the seriousness of the possible non-compliance; the likelihood of its occurrence; and other possible indicators, such as the introduction of vehicles with new technology installed, any past history or reports of non-compliance, the results of remote sensing testing and the concerns expressed by recognised third parties.

(35)

In addition, in order to verify compliance with the relevant requirements, the Commission should organise and carry out compliance verification tests and inspections that are independent of those carried out by Member States under their national market surveillance obligations. Where such tests and inspections take place on registered vehicles in agreement with the holder of the vehicle registration certificate, it is important to take into account the fact that modified vehicles might be unsuited to such verification of compliance. It is also important to take into account the implications for the holder of the vehicle registration certificate, especially where the holder is a natural person, in the case of which the suitable way of selecting the vehicles is either by way of a public call or through the Member States' authorities. Where those tests and inspections establish non-compliance, or where it is found that a type-approval has been granted on the basis of incorrect data, the Commission should be entitled to initiate Union-wide remedial actions to restore the conformity of the vehicles concerned, and to investigate the reasons why the type-approval was incorrect. Appropriate funding should be ensured in the general budget of the Union to enable the execution of such compliance verification tests and inspections.

(36)

In order to support Member States in the task of detecting defeat devices, the Commission published, on 26 January 2017, Guidance on the evaluation of Auxiliary Emission Strategies and the presence of Defeat Devices with regard to the application of Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 on type approval of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 and Euro 6). Consistent with that Guidance, the test activities of the Commission, of the type-approval authorities and of the technical services for the purpose of detecting defeat devices should remain non-predictable in character, and should also include modified testing conditions which entail variations in physical conditions and testing parameters.

(37)

In order to ensure a high level of vehicle functional safety, to ensure the protection of vehicle's occupants and other road users, and to ensure the protection of the environment and health, the technical requirements and environmental standards that apply to vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units should continue to be harmonised and adapted to reflect the technical and scientific progress.

(38)

The objective of this Regulation should not be affected by the fact that certain systems, components, separate technical units, parts and equipment can be fitted to or in a vehicle after that vehicle has been placed on the market, has been registered or has entered into service. Appropriate measures should therefore be taken to ensure that the systems, components, separate technical units or parts and equipment that can be fitted to or in vehicles and that can significantly impair the functioning of systems that are essential for environmental protection or functional safety are subject to controls by an approval authority before they are placed on the market, registered or entered into service.

(39)

Those measures should only apply to a limited number of parts or equipment. In the event of serious risk, the Commission should establish the list of such parts or equipment and the corresponding requirements as a matter of priority, after having consulted stakeholders. In establishing the list, the Commission should ensure in particular that replacement parts and equipment that are essential for emission controls and safety meet the performance specifications of the original parts and equipment. It should also consult stakeholders on the basis of a report, and should strive for a fair balance between the requirements of improving road safety and environmental protection, as well as a fair balance between the interests of consumers, manufacturers and distributors while preserving competition in the aftermarket.

(40)

The EU type-approval system has to enable each Member State to confirm that every type of vehicle and every type of system, component and separate technical unit intended for such type of vehicle has undergone the tests and inspections provided for in this Regulation to verify its compliance with the type-approval requirements of this Regulation and that its manufacturer has obtained a type-approval certificate for it. The EU type-approval system obliges manufacturers to produce their vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units in conformity with the approved type. A vehicle manufacturer has to certify this by issuing a certificate of conformity for every vehicle. Every vehicle which has a valid certificate of conformity should be permitted to be made available on the market and registered in the Union.

(41)

In order to simplify the exchange of information related to type-approval between the competent authorities and to make relevant information publically accessible after appropriate implementation periods, the use of searchable online databases should be compulsory. To preserve confidential data, it is important for all data exchange to be performed by means of secure data exchange protocols. Special attention should be paid to eliminating data misuse, including avoidance of creating multiple first time registrations when using certificates of conformity in electronic format.

(42)

Conformity of production is one of the cornerstones of the EU type-approval system, and therefore the arrangements set up by the manufacturer to ensure such conformity should be approved by the competent authority or by an appropriately qualified technical service designated for that purpose, and should be subject to regular verification by means of independent periodic audits. In addition, approval authorities should ensure the verification of the continued conformity of the automotive products concerned.

(43)

The continued validity of the type-approvals requires that the manufacturer inform the authority that has approved its type of vehicle of any changes to the characteristics of the type or to the safety and environmental performance requirements applicable to that type so that it can be verified that the type of vehicle continues to comply with all the applicable requirements. Furthermore, the conditions for amending type-approvals should be clarified to ensure the uniform application of the procedures and the enforcement of the type-approval requirements throughout the Union, in particular to ensure the strict application of the rules that distinguish between amended type-approvals and new type-approvals. To ensure that the latest requirements are implemented on all new vehicles at a certain point in time, it is important that regulatory acts listed in Annex II include not only a date for the application of new requirements to new type-approvals, but also a date as of which new requirements become mandatory for the making available on the market, registration or entry into service of vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units.

(44)

The assessment of reported serious risk to safety and of harm to public health and the environment should be conducted at national level, but coordination at Union level should be ensured where a reported risk or harm may extend beyond the territory of one Member State, with the objective of sharing resources and ensuring consistency regarding the corrective actions to be taken to mitigate the identified risk or harm.

(45)

In order to ensure that all vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units placed on the market offer a high level of safety and of environmental protection, the manufacturer or any other economic operator in the supply chain should take appropriate corrective measures, including recalling vehicles, where a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit presents a serious risk to users or the environment as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Approval authorities should be empowered to assess and verify whether those corrective measures are adequate. The approval authorities of other Member States' should have the right to take corrective and restrictive measures where they consider that the manufacturer's corrective measures are not adequate.

(46)

Where corrective measures are applied, holders of registrations for affected vehicles should not bear the cost of the repairs to their vehicles, including in cases where repairs have been carried out at the registration holder's expense before the adoption of the corrective measure. This should not prevent consumers relying on remedies based on contract law, as applicable under Union or national law.

(47)

Appropriate flexibility should be provided by means of alternative approval schemes for manufacturers of vehicles produced in small series. They should be able to benefit from the advantages of the internal market, provided that their vehicles comply with the specific EU type-approval requirements for vehicles produced in small series. In certain limited cases, it is appropriate to allow for national small series type-approval. In order to prevent misuse, any simplified procedure for vehicles produced in small series should be restricted to cases involving very limited production in accordance with this Regulation. It is therefore necessary to precisely define the concept of vehicles produced in small series in terms of the number of vehicles produced, the requirements to be complied with and the conditions for placing those vehicles on the market. It is equally important to specify an alternative approval scheme for individual vehicles, in particular to provide sufficient flexibility for the approval of vehicles built in multiple stages.

(48)

The Union is a Contracting Party to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe of 20 March 1958 concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions (‘Revised 1958 Agreement’)

(

5

)

. The Union has accepted a significant number of Regulations annexed to the Revised 1958 Agreement, and therefore has the obligation to accept type-approvals granted in accordance with those Regulations as complying with the equivalent Union requirements. For the purpose of simplifying its framework for type-approval and aligning it with the international framework of the United Nations (UN), in Regulation (EC) No 661/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

6

)

, the Union repealed its specific type-approval Directives and replaced them with the obligatory application of the relevant UN Regulations. To reduce the administrative burden of the type-approval process, where appropriate, manufacturers of vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units should be allowed to seek type-approval directly in accordance with this Regulation by obtaining approval under the relevant UN Regulations referred to in the Annexes to this Regulation.

(49)

Consequently, the UN Regulations and the amendments thereto which the Union has voted in favour of or that the Union applies in accordance with Decision 97/836/EC should be incorporated within the EU type-approval legislation. Accordingly, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to amend the Annexes to this Regulation to ensure that the references to the UN Regulations and their respective amendments in the list of the relevant regulatory acts are kept up-to-date.

(50)

Unrestricted access to vehicle repair and maintenance information, via a standardised format that can be used to retrieve the technical information, and effective competition in the market for services providing such information, are necessary to improve the functioning of the internal market, in particular as regards the free movement of goods, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services. The requirements for the provision of repair and maintenance information have so far been laid down in Regulations (EC) No 715/2007

(

7

)

and (EC) No 595/2009

(

8

)

of the European Parliament and of the Council. Those requirements should be consolidated in this Regulation and Regulations (EC) No 715/2007 and (EC) No 595/2009 should be amended accordingly.

(51)

Technical progress introducing new methods or techniques for vehicle diagnostics and repair, such as remote access to vehicle information and software, should not weaken the objective of this Regulation with respect to access to vehicle repair and maintenance information for independent operators.

(52)

In order to ensure effective competition in the market for vehicle repair and maintenance information services, and in order to clarify that the information concerned also covers information which needs to be provided to independent operators other than repairers, so as to ensure that the independent vehicle repair and maintenance market as a whole can compete with authorised dealers, regardless of whether the vehicle manufacturer gives such information to authorised dealers and repairers or uses such information for the repair and maintenance purposes itself, it is necessary to set out the details of the information to be provided for the purposes of access to vehicle repair and maintenance information.

(53)

For the inspection of vehicles, and in particular for their safety- and environment- related components, it is considered to be necessary for testing centres and relevant competent authorities to have access to the technical information of each individual vehicle, as set out in Directive 2014/45/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

9

)

. In order to facilitate compliance with the requirements laid down in that Directive, the independent operators should have access to the relevant technical information needed for the preparation of vehicles for road worthiness tests.

(54)

Since there is currently no common structured process for the exchange of vehicle component data between vehicle manufacturers and independent operators, it is appropriate to develop principles for such exchanges of data. A future common structured process on the standardised format of the exchanges of data should be formally developed by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), although the mandate given to CEN does not predetermine the level of detail that standard will provide. The CEN's work should, in particular, reflect the interests and needs of vehicle manufacturers and independent operators alike and should also investigate solutions such as open data formats described by well-defined meta-data to accommodate existing information technology infrastructures.

(55)

In order to ensure the effectiveness of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of type-approval requirements concerning the environmental and safety performance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making

(

10

)

. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.

(56)

In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

11

)

.

(57)

Member States should lay down rules on penalties for the infringements of this Regulation, and should ensure that those rules are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. In particular, they should reflect, the risk to safety, health or the environment that the number of non-compliant vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units made available on the market could pose. Member States should report the imposed penalties to the Commission annually, to monitor the coherence of the implementation of those rules.

(58)

When performing compliance verification testing, technical services should be able to choose the parameters of the tests freely and in a non-predictable manner from within the range provided for in the relevant regulatory acts. This should help them verify that the vehicles tested are compliant across the whole range of parameters, including the parameters that correspond to the worst case for the test.

(59)

In order to ensure that the vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units comply with this Regulation in all cases, they should be deemed not to comply with the relevant requirements where test results cannot be empirically verified by the relevant authority even though all testing parameters have been replicated or taken into account. It is necessary to impose penalties on economic operators and technical services who falsify test results or submit false declarations or incorrect data for type-approval.

(60)

In the interests of clarity, rationality and simplification, Directive 2007/46/EC should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation. The adoption of this Regulation ensures that provisions are directly applicable and that they can be updated in a timely and more efficient manner to take better account of technical progress and regulatory developments in the context of the Revised 1958 Agreement.

(61)

In order to support corrective and restrictive measures at Union level, the Commission should have the power to impose harmonised administrative fines upon the economic operators found to have infringed upon this Regulation regardless of where a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit was originally type-approved. The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by laying down the procedure for, and methods for calculation and collection of, those administrative fines, on the basis of the principles laid down in this Regulation.

(62)

Whenever the measures provided for in this Regulation entail the processing of personal data, they should be carried out in accordance with Regulations (EU) 2016/679

(

12

)

and (EC) No 45/2001

(

13

)

of the European Parliament and of the Council as well as the national implementing measures thereto. It is important that manufacturers implement all measures necessary to comply with the rules on processing and transmission of personal data that are generated while the vehicle is used.

(63)

In order to enable Member States and national authorities as well as economic operators to prepare for the application of the new rules introduced by this Regulation, a date of application falling after the date of the entry into force should be set.

(64)

Since the objective of this Regulation, namely laying down administrative provisions and technical requirements for the type-approval of new vehicles of categories M, N and O, and for the type-approval of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, as well as for the market surveillance of such vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

CHAPTER I

1.   The Commission shall organise and carry out assessments of the procedures put in place by approval authorities that have granted EU type-approvals within the five years preceding the assessment, in particular of the procedures for granting type-approvals, for carrying out conformity of production and for the designation and monitoring of technical services. Such assessments shall include an evaluation, using a random sample, of the compliance of granted type-approvals with applicable requirements referred to in point (c) of Article 26(2) within the five years preceding the assessment.

2.   The assessments shall aim to assist the approval authorities that grant EU type-approvals to ensure the uniform application of this Regulation and to share best practices.

3.   The assessments shall be carried out in compliance with the law of the Member State concerned, with due regard for the rights of the authorities concerned, and shall comply with the principle of proportionality. The Commission shall carry out its duties independently and impartially, and shall observe confidentiality in order to protect commercial secrets in accordance with the applicable law. The Commission shall bear the costs arising from such assessments.

4.   The approval authorities concerned shall facilitate the assessment by cooperating with the Commission, giving it any necessary assistance and providing it with any necessary documentation.

5.   The Commission shall ensure that the personnel participating in the assessment are sufficiently qualified and adequately instructed. The Commission shall, a sufficient time before the assessment, inform the Member States and the approval authorities concerned of the date on which the assessment is to begin and the identity of the personnel who are to carry out the assessment. The duration of the assessment at the premises of the approval authority concerned shall not normally exceed two days, and shall not in any case exceed three days.

6.   Each approval authority that has granted at least one EU type-approval during a five year period shall be assessed by the Commission once during that period.

By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, the assessment of an approval authority may be less frequent if the Commission considers that the first assessment of that authority demonstrates that the procedures put in place ensure the effective application of this Regulation, taking into account the scope and range of EU type-approvals granted.

7.   The Commission shall communicate the outcome of the assessment, including any recommendations, to the Forum and shall make a summary of the outcome publicly available. The Forum shall examine the outcome of the assessment.

8.   The Member States shall report to the Commission and to the Forum on how they address any recommendations included in the outcome of the assessment.

9.   Taking duly into account the considerations of the Forum, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down common criteria for setting out the scope of, and the methodology used for, the assessment, the composition of the assessment team, the plan for the assessments covering a period of at least five years and the specific conditions under which the frequency of such assessments may be reduced. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 83(2).

2.   Manufacturers shall be responsible to the approval authority for all aspects of the approval procedure and for ensuring conformity of production.

In the case of multi-stage type-approval, manufacturers shall also be responsible for the approval and conformity of production of the systems, components or separate technical units that they have added at the stage of vehicle completion. Manufacturers who modify components, systems or separate technical units already approved at earlier stages shall be responsible for the type-approval and conformity of production of the modified components, systems or separate technical units. Manufacturers of the previous stage shall provide information to manufacturers of the subsequent stage regarding any change that may affect component type-approval, system type-approval or separate technical unit type-approval or the whole-vehicle type-approval. Such information shall be provided as soon as the new extension to the whole-vehicle type-approval has been granted and at the latest on the starting date of manufacture of the incomplete vehicle.

3.   Manufacturers who modify an incomplete vehicle in such a manner that it qualifies as a different category of vehicle, with the consequence that the requirements already assessed in a previous stage of type-approval have changed, shall also be responsible for compliance with the requirements applicable to the category of vehicles for which the modified vehicle qualifies.

4.   For the purposes of EU type-approval of vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units, a manufacturer established outside the Union shall appoint a single representative established within the Union to represent the manufacturer before the approval authority. That manufacturer shall also appoint a single representative established within the Union for the purposes of market surveillance, who may be the same as the representative appointed for the purposes of EU type-approval.

5.   Manufacturers shall ensure that their vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units are not designed to incorporate strategies or other means that alter the performance exhibited during test procedures in such a way that they do not comply with this Regulation when operating under conditions that can reasonably be expected in normal operation.

6.   Manufacturers shall establish procedures to ensure that series production of vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units remains in conformity with the approved type.

7.   Manufacturers shall examine any complaints they receive relating to risks, suspected incidents or non-compliance issues with the vehicles, systems, components, separate technical units, parts and equipment that they have placed on the market.

Manufacturers shall keep a record of such complaints, including for each complaint a description of the issue and the details needed to precisely identify the affected type of vehicle, system, component, separate technical unit, part or equipment, and, in the case of substantiated complaints, manufacturers shall keep their distributors and importers informed thereof.

8.   In addition to the statutory plate fixed to their vehicles and type-approval marks fixed to their components or separate technical units in accordance with Article 38, manufacturers shall indicate their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and their contact address in the Union on their vehicles, components or separate technical units made available on the market or, where that is not possible, on the packaging or in a document accompanying the component or separate technical unit.

9.   Manufacturers shall ensure that, while a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit is under their responsibility, storage or transport conditions do not jeopardise its compliance with the requirements laid down in this Regulation.

10.   Without prejudice to Article 9(5) and subject to the protection of commercial secrets and the preservation of personal data pursuant to Union and national law, manufacturers of vehicles shall make available data which is needed for testing by third parties for possible non-compliance, including all parameters and settings that are necessary to accurately replicate the test conditions that were applied at the time of the type-approval testing.

For the purposes of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the data to be made available free of charge, as well as the requirements to be met by third parties to demonstrate their legitimate interest in the fields of public safety or environmental protection and their recourse to adequate testing facilities. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 83(2).

The relevant economic operators and the relevant approval authorities shall cooperate fully with the market surveillance authorities, which shall include forwarding the results of all relevant checks or tests performed in accordance with Article 31.

Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 shall apply to the risk assessment of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned.

Article 52

National procedures for dealing with vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units presenting a serious risk or non-compliance

1.   Where, after having performed the evaluation pursuant to Article 51, the market surveillance authority of one Member State finds that a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit presents a serious risk to the health or safety of persons or to other aspects of the protection of public interests covered by this Regulation, it shall require without delay that the relevant economic operator take all appropriate corrective measures without delay to ensure that the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned, when placed on the market, registered or entered into service, no longer presents that risk.

2.   Where, after having performed the evaluation pursuant to Article 51, the market surveillance authority of one Member State finds that a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit does not comply with this Regulation, but does not present a serious risk as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall require without delay that the relevant economic operator take all appropriate corrective measures within a reasonable period to bring a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit into compliance. That period shall be proportionate to the seriousness of non-compliance to ensure that the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned is compliant when it is placed on the market, is registered, or enters into service.

Economic operators shall, in accordance with the obligations set out in Articles 13 to 21, ensure that all appropriate corrective measures are taken in respect of all concerned vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units that they have placed on the market, registered or entered into service in the Union.

3.   Where economic operators do not take adequate corrective measures within the relevant period referred to in paragraph 1 or 2, or where the risk requires rapid action, the national authorities shall take all appropriate provisional restrictive measures to prohibit or restrict the making available on the market, the registration or the entry into service of the concerned vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units, on their national market, or to withdraw them from that market or to recall them.

Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 shall apply to the restrictive measures referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph.

4.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down a classification of the seriousness of the non-compliance and the appropriate measures to be taken by national authorities to ensure the uniform application of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 83(2).

Article 53

2.   The Member State that takes the corrective or restrictive measure shall also indicate whether the risk or the non-compliance is due to the following:

(a)

the failure of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit to meet requirements relating to the health or safety of persons, to the protection of the environment or to other aspects of the protection of public interests covered by this Regulation; or

(b)

shortcomings in the relevant regulatory acts listed in Annex II.

3.   The delegated acts referred to in paragraph 2 shall respect the following principles:

(a)

the procedure by the Commission shall respect the right to good administration, and in particular the right to be heard and the right to have access to the file, while respecting the legitimate interests of confidentiality and of commercial secrets;

(b)

in calculating the appropriate administrative fine, the Commission shall be guided by the principles of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness, taking into consideration, where relevant, the seriousness and the effects of the infringement, the good faith of the economic operator, the degree of diligence and cooperation of the economic operator, the repetition, frequency or duration of the infringement as well as prior sanctions imposed on the same economic operator;

(c)

administrative fines shall be collected without undue delay by fixing deadlines for the payment and, as appropriate, including the possibility of splitting payments into several instalments and phases.

4.   The amounts of administrative fines shall be considered as revenue for the general budget of the Union.

2.   General provisions

2.1.   Number of seating positions

2.1.1.   The requirements regarding the number of seating positions apply to seats that are designed for use when the vehicle is travelling on the road.

2.1.2.   They do not apply to seats that are designed for use when the vehicle is stationary and which are clearly identified to users either by means of a pictogram or a sign with an appropriate text.

2.1.3.   The following requirements apply for the counting of the seating positions:

(a)

each individual seat shall be counted as one seating position;

(b)

in the case of a bench seat, any space having a width of at least 400 mm measured at the seat cushion level shall be counted as one seating position.

This condition shall not prevent the manufacturer from using the general provisions referred to in point 1.1;

(c)

however, a space as referred to in point (b) shall not be counted as one seating position where:

(i)

the bench seat includes features that prevent the bottom of the manikin from sitting in a natural way - for example: the presence of a fixed console box, an unpadded area or an interior trim interrupting the nominal seating surface;

(ii)

the design of the floor pan located immediately in front of a presumed seating position (for example the presence of a tunnel) prevents the feet of the manikin from being positioned in a natural way.

2.1.4.   With respect to vehicles covered by UN Regulations No 66 and No 107, the dimension referred to in point 2.1.3(b) shall be aligned with the minimum space required for one person in relation to the various classes of vehicles.

2.1.5.   When seat anchors for a removable seat are present in a vehicle, the removable seat shall be counted in the determination of the number of the seating positions.

2.1.6.   An area intended for an occupied wheelchair shall be regarded as one seating position.

2.1.6.1.   This provision shall be without prejudice to the requirements of paragraphs 3.6.1 and 3.7 of Annex 8 to UN Regulation No 107.

2.2.   Maximum mass

2.2.1.   In the case of a tractor unit for semi-trailer, the maximum mass to be considered for classifying the vehicle shall include the maximum mass of the semi-trailer borne by the fifth wheel coupling.

2.2.2.   In the case of a motor vehicle that can tow a centre-axle trailer or a rigid drawbar trailer, the maximum mass to be considered for classifying the motor vehicle shall include the maximum mass transferred to the towing vehicle by the coupling.

2.2.3.   In the case of a semi-trailer, a centre-axle trailer and a rigid drawbar trailer, the maximum mass to be considered for classifying the vehicle shall correspond to the maximum mass transmitted to the ground by the wheels of an axle or group of axles when coupled to the towing vehicle.

2.2.4.   In the case of a converter dolly, the maximum mass to be considered for classifying the vehicle shall include the maximum mass of the semi-trailer borne by the fifth wheel coupling.

2.3.   Special equipment

2.3.1.   Vehicles fitted primarily with fixed equipment such as machinery or apparatus shall be regarded as N or O category.

2.4.   Units

2.4.1.   Unless otherwise stated any unit of measurement and associated symbol shall conform to Council Directive 80/181/EEC

(

7.1.   When a vehicle falls into several categories because of its maximum mass or the number of seating positions or both, the manufacturer may select to use the criteria of one or the other vehicle category for the definition of the variants and the versions.

7.1.1.   Examples:

(a)

a vehicle ‘A’ may be type-approved as N

1

(3,5 tonnes) and N

2

(4,2 tonnes) in relation to its maximum mass. In such a case, the parameters mentioned in category N

1

may be used also for the vehicle that falls into category N

2

(or vice-versa);

(b)

a vehicle ‘B’ may be type-approved as M

1

and M

2

in relation to the number of seating positions (7 + 1 or 10 + 1), the parameters mentioned in category M

1

may be used also for the vehicle that falls into category M

2

(or vice-versa).

7.2.   A vehicle of category N may be type-approved against the provisions required for category M

1

or M

2

, as the case may be, when it is intended to be converted into a vehicle of that category during the next step of a multi-stage type-approval procedure.

7.2.1.   This option shall only be permitted for incomplete vehicles.

Such vehicles shall be identified by a specific variant code given by the manufacturer of the base vehicle.

7.3.   Type-, variant- and version designations

7.3.1.   The manufacturer shall allocate an alphanumeric code to each type of vehicle, variant and version, made up of Roman letters and/or Arabic numerals.

The use of brackets and hyphens is permitted provided they do not replace a letter or a numeral.

7.3.2.   The whole code shall be designated: Type-Variant-Version or ‘TVV’.

7.3.3.   The TVV shall clearly and unequivocally identify a unique combination of technical features in relation to the criteria defined in this Part.

7.3.4.   The same manufacturer may use the same code in order to define a type of vehicle when the latter falls in two or more categories.

7.3.5.   The same manufacturer shall not use the same code in order to define a type of vehicle for more than one type-approval within the same vehicle category.

7.4.   Number of characters for the TVV

7.4.1.   The number of characters shall not exceed:

(a)

15 for the code of the type of vehicle;

(b)

25 for the code of one variant;

(c)

35 for the code of one version.

7.4.2.   The complete alphanumeric ‘TVV’ shall not contain more than 75 characters.

7.4.3.   When the TVV is used as a whole, a space shall be left between the type, the variant and the version.

Example of such TVV: 159AF[…space]0054[…space]977K(BE).

PART C

Appendix 2

Requirements for EU individual vehicle approval pursuant to Article 44

1.   APPLICATION

For the purpose of application of this Appendix, a vehicle is deemed to be new where:

(a)

it has never been registered previously; or

(b)

it has been registered for less than six months at the time of the application for individual vehicle approval.

A vehicle shall be considered registered where it has obtained a permanent, temporary or short-term administrative authorisation for entry into service in road traffic, involving its identification and the issuing of a registration number

(

)

.

2.   ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

2.1.   Categorisation of the vehicle

Vehicles shall be categorised in accordance with the criteria set out in Annex I as follows:

(a)

the actual number of seating positions shall be taken into consideration; and

(b)

the technically maximum permissible laden mass shall be the maximum mass stated by the manufacturer in the country of origin and available in his official documentation.

Where it is not possible to easily determine the vehicle category because of the design of the bodywork, the conditions set out in Annex I shall apply.

2.2.   Application for individual vehicle approval

(a)

The applicant shall submit an application to the approval authority accompanied by all relevant documentation necessary for the operation of the approval procedure.

Where the submitted documentation is incomplete, falsified or forged the application for approval shall be rejected.

(b)

Only one application for a particular vehicle may be submitted in only one Member State. The approval authority may require from the applicant a written commitment that only one application will be submitted in the Member State of the approval authority.

By a particular vehicle, it shall be understood a physical vehicle the VIN of which is clearly identified.

However, any applicant may apply for EU individual vehicle approval in another Member State in respect of another particular vehicle with technical characteristics identical or similar to the one that has been granted an EU individual vehicle approval.

(c)

The model of the application form and the layout of the file shall be laid down by the approval authority.

The particulars of the vehicle requested may only consist in an appropriate selection of the information included in Annex I.

(d)

The technical requirements to be complied with are those laid down in point 4.

The technical requirements shall be those applicable to vehicles belonging to a type of vehicle currently in production, in relation to the date of the submission of the application.

(e)

With respect to the tests required under the regulatory acts listed in this Annex, the applicant shall supply a statement of compliance with recognised international standards or regulations. The statement in question may only be issued by the vehicle manufacturer.

‘Statement of compliance’ shall mean a statement issued by the office or department within the manufacturer's organisation that is duly authorised by the management to fully engage the legal responsibility of the manufacturer with respect to the design and the construction of a vehicle.

The regulatory acts for which such a statement has to be supplied shall be those referred to in point 4.

Where a statement of compliance gives rise to uncertainty, the applicant may be required to obtain from the manufacturer a piece of evidence, including a test report, in order to corroborate the manufacturer's statement.

2.3.   Technical services entrusted with individual vehicle approvals

(a)

The technical services entrusted with individual vehicle approvals shall be of category A as referred to in Article 68(1).

(b)

By way of derogation from the requirement to demonstrate their compliance with the standards listed in Appendix 1 to Annex III, technical services shall comply with the following standards:

(i)

EN ISO/IEC 17025:2005 when they perform tests themselves;

(ii)

EN ISO/IEC 17020:2012 when they check compliance of the vehicle with the requirements included in this Appendix.

(c)

Where specific tests requiring specific skills have to be conducted at the request of the applicant, they shall be conducted by one of the technical services notified to the Commission at the choice of the applicant.

2.4.   Test reports

(a)

Test reports shall be drafted in accordance with paragraph 5.10.2 of standard EN ISO/IEC 17025:2005.

(b)

Test reports shall be drafted in one of the languages of the Union determined by the approval authority.

Where in application of point 2.3(c) a test report has been issued in a Member State other than the one entrusted with the individual vehicle approval, the approval authority may require that the applicant submits a true translation of the test report.

(c)

Test reports shall include a description of the vehicle tested, including its identification. The parts that play a significant role with regard to the results of the tests shall be described and their identification number reported.

(d)

At the request of an applicant, a test report delivered for a system related to a particular vehicle may be presented repeatedly either by the same or another applicant for the purposes of individual approval of another vehicle.

In such a case, the approval authority shall ensure that the technical characteristics of the vehicle are properly inspected against the test report.

Inspection of the vehicle and the documentation accompanying the test report shall demonstrate that the vehicle for which an individual approval is sought has the same characteristics as the vehicle described in the report.

(e)

Additional requirements for testing the wheelchair tie-down and occupant restraint system

The following point 2 and either point 3 or 4 shall apply.

1.   Definitions

1.1.   Surrogate wheelchair (SWC) means a rigid, re-usable test wheelchair, as defined in section 3 of international standard ISO 10542-1:2012.

1.2.   Point P means a representation of the position of the wheelchair occupant's hip when seated in the SWC, as defined in section 3 of international standard ISO 10542-1:2012.

2.   General requirements

2.1.   Each wheelchair location shall be provided with anchorages to which a wheelchair tie-down and occupant restraint system (WTORS) shall be fitted.

2.2.   The wheelchair occupant's lower belt anchorages shall be located in accordance with UN Regulation No 14.07, paragraph 5.4.2.2, relative to Point P on the SWC, when placed in the travelling position designated by the manufacturer. The upper actual anchorage(s) shall be located at least 1 100 mm above the horizontal plane passing through the points of contact between the rear tyres of the SWC and the vehicle floor. That condition shall still be satisfied after the test carried out in accordance with point 3 of this Appendix.

2.3.   An assessment shall be made of the WTORS occupant belt to ensure compliance with the UN Regulation No 16.06, paragraphs 8.2.2 to 8.2.2.4 and 8.3.1 to 8.3.4.

2.4.   The minimum number of ISOFIX child seat anchorages need not to be provided. In the case of a multi-stage type-approval where an ISOFIX anchorage system has been affected by the conversion, either the system shall be re-tested or the anchorages shall be rendered unusable. In the latter case the ISOFIX labels shall be removed and appropriate information shall be given to the vehicle purchaser.

3.   Static in-vehicle testing

3.1.   Wheelchair occupant restraint anchorages

3.1.1.

The wheelchair occupant restraint anchorages shall resist the static forces prescribed for occupant restraint anchorages in UN Regulation No 14.07, simultaneously with the static forces applied to the wheelchair tie-down anchorages as specified in point 3.2 of this Appendix.

3.2.   Wheelchair tie-down anchorages

The wheelchair tie-down anchorages shall resist the following forces, for at least 0,2 seconds, applied via the SWC (or a suitable surrogate wheelchair having a wheelbase, seat height and tie-down attachment points in accordance with the specification for the SWC), at a height of 300 +/– 100 mm from the surface on which the SWC rests:

3.2.1.

In the case of a forward-facing wheelchair, a simultaneous force, coincident with the force applied to the occupant restraint anchorages, of 24,5 kN, and

3.2.2.

a second test applying a static force of 8,2 kN directed towards the rear of the vehicle.

3.2.3.

In the case of a rearward-facing wheelchair, a simultaneous force, coincident with the force applied to the occupant restraint anchorages, of 8,2 kN, and

3.2.4.

a second test applying a static force of 24,5 kN directed towards the front of the vehicle.

3.3.   Components of the system

3.3.1.

All components of the WTORS shall meet the relevant requirements of international standard ISO 10542-1:2012. However, the dynamic test specified in Annex A and paragraphs 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 of international standard ISO 10542-1:2012 shall be carried out on the complete WTORS using the vehicle anchorage geometry instead of the test geometry specified in Annex A of international standard ISO 10542-1:2012. This may be carried out within the vehicle structure or on a surrogate structure representative of the vehicle's WTORS anchorage geometry. The location of each anchorage shall lie within the tolerance provided for in paragraph 7.7.1 of UN Regulation No 16.06.

3.3.2.

Where the occupant restraint part of the WTORS is approved in accordance with UN Regulation No 16.06, it shall be subject to the dynamic test of the complete WTORS specified in paragraph 3.3.1 of this Appendix but the requirements of paragraphs 5.1, 5.3 and 5.4 of international standard ISO10542-1:2012 shall be considered to have been met.

4.   Dynamic in-vehicle testing

4.1.   The full assembly of the WTORS system shall be tested by an in-vehicle dynamic test in accordance with paragraphs 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 and Annex A of international standard ISO 10542-1:2012, testing all components/anchorages simultaneously, using a vehicle body-in-white or representative structure.

4.2.   The component parts of the WTORS shall meet the relevant requirements of international standard ISO 10542-1:2012, paragraphs 5.1, 5.3 and 5.4. These requirements shall be deemed to have been met in respect of the occupant restraint if it is approved in accordance with UN Regulation No 16.06.

Appendix 4

Other special purpose vehicles

(including special group, multi-equipment carrier and trailer caravans)

The exemptions provided for in this Appendix are only permitted if the manufacturer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the approval authority that the vehicle, due to the special function, cannot meet all the requirements set out in Part I of this Annex.

ANNEX IV

CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION PROCEDURES

1.   Objectives

1.1.   The conformity of production procedure aims to ensure that each vehicle, system, component and technical separate unit, part or equipment produced is in conformity with the approved type.

1.2.   The conformity of production procedure shall always include the assessment of quality-assurance management systems, referred to in point 2 as the ‘initial assessment’, and the verification of the type-approval subject and product-related controls, referred to in point 3 as ‘product conformity arrangements’.

2.   Initial assessment

2.1.   Before granting type-approval, the approval authority shall verify that the manufacturer has established satisfactory arrangements and procedures for ensuring that vehicles, systems, components, separate technical units or parts and equipment are produced in conformity with the approved type.

2.2.   Guidance for conducting those assessments may be found in standard EN ISO 19011:2011 — Guidelines for auditing management systems.

2.3.   Compliance with the requirements of point 2.1 shall be verified to the satisfaction of the approval authority, as follows:

The approval authority shall be satisfied with the initial assessment and the product conformity arrangements referred to in point 3, taking into account one of the arrangements referred to in points 2.3.1 to 2.3.3, or a combination of those arrangements in full or in part as appropriate.

2.3.1.   The initial assessment and verification of product conformity arrangements shall be carried out by the approval authority or a body designated for that purpose by the approval authority.

2.3.1.1.   When considering the extent of the initial assessment to be carried out, the approval authority may take into account the following information:

(a)

whether the manufacturer has a certification similar to the one referred to in point 2.3.3, but which has not been qualified or recognised under that point;

(b)

in the case of a type-approval of a system, component or separate technical unit, quality system assessments that have been performed by vehicle manufacturer(s) in the premises of the manufacturer of the system, component or separate technical unit, in accordance with one or more of the industry sector specifications satisfying the requirements in the standard EN ISO 9001:2015 or ISO/TS16949:2009;

(c)

whether in one of the Member States one or more of the manufacturer's type-approvals recently have been withdrawn, due to unsatisfactory control of conformity of production. In that case, the initial assessment by the approval authority shall not be limited to accepting the manufacturer's quality system certification, but shall include a verification whether all necessary improvements for ensuring effective control have been implemented, so that vehicles, components, systems or separate technical units are produced in conformity with the approved type.

2.3.2.   The initial assessment and verification of product conformity arrangements may be carried out by the approval authority of another Member State or by the body designated for that purpose by the approval authority.

2.3.2.1.   The approval authority of that other Member State shall in that case prepare a statement of compliance, which outlines the areas and production facilities that that approval authority has covered as relevant to the product(s) to be type-approved and to the regulatory acts in accordance with which these products are to be type-approved.

2.3.2.2.   Upon receiving a request for a statement of compliance from the approval authority of a Member State granting type-approval, the approval authority of another Member State shall immediately send that statement of compliance or inform that approval authority that is unable to provide such a statement.

2.3.2.3.   The statement of compliance shall include at least the following:

(a)

Group or company

(e.g. XYZ Automotive)

(b)

Particular organisation

(e.g. regional Division)

(c)

Plants/Sites

(e.g. Engine Plant 1 (in country A) — Vehicle Plant 2 (in country B))

(d)

Vehicle/Component range

(e.g. All Category M

1

models)

(e)

Areas assessed

(e.g. Engine assembly, body pressing and assembly, vehicle assembly)

(f)

Documents examined

(e.g. Company and site quality manual and procedures)

(g)

Date of the assessment

(e.g. Audit conducted from dd/mm/yyyy to dd/mm/yyyy)

(h)

Planned monitoring visit

(e.g. mm/yyyy)

2.3.3.   An approval authority may also accept the manufacturer's certification to standards EN ISO 9001:2015 or ISO/TS16949:2009 (the scope of that certification shall in that case cover the product(s) to be approved), or an equivalent certification standard as satisfying the initial assessment requirements of point 2.3., provided that conformity of production is indeed covered by the quality management system and that the manufacturer's type-approval has not been withdrawn as referred to in point 2.3.1.1.(c). The manufacturer shall provide details of the certification and inform the approval authority of any revisions to its validity or scope.

2.4.   For the purpose of vehicle type-approval, the initial assessments carried out for the granting of type-approvals for systems, components and separate technical units of the vehicle need not be repeated, but shall be completed by an assessment of the locations and activities relating to the assembly of the whole vehicle that have not been covered by the initial assessments.

3.   Product conformity arrangements

3.1.   Every vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit, part or item of equipment approved pursuant to a UN Regulation annexed to the Revised 1958 Agreement and to this Regulation shall be so manufactured as to conform to the type approved by meeting the requirements of this Annex, the said UN Regulation and this Regulation.

3.2.   Before granting a type-approval pursuant to this Regulation and to a UN Regulation annexed to the Revised 1958 Agreement, the approval authority shall verify the existence of adequate product conformity arrangements and documented control plans, to be agreed with the manufacturer for each approval, to carry out at specified intervals the tests or associated checks that are necessary to verify continued conformity with the approved type, including, where applicable, tests specified in this Regulation and the said UN Regulation.

3.3.   The holder of the type-approval shall, in particular:

3.3.1.

ensure the existence and application of procedures for effective control of the conformity of vehicles, systems, components, separate technical units, parts or equipment to the approved type;

3.3.2.

have access to the testing or other appropriate equipment necessary for checking the conformity to each approved type;

3.3.3.

ensure that the data resulting from tests or checks are recorded and that annexed documents remain available for a period of up to 10 years to be determined in agreement with the approval authority;

3.3.4.

analyse the results of each type of test or check, in order to verify and ensure the stability of the product characteristics, making allowance for variation of an industrial production;

3.3.5.

ensure that for each type of product, at least the checks prescribed in this Regulation and the tests prescribed in the relevant regulatory acts listed in Annex II are carried out;

3.3.6.

ensure that any set of samples or test pieces that gives evidence of non-conformity in the type of test in question, gives rise to a further sampling and testing. All the necessary steps shall be taken to restore the production process to ensure conformity with the approved type.

3.4.   In the case of step-by-step, mixed or multi-stage type-approvals, the approval authority that is granting a whole-vehicle type-approval may request from any approval authority that has granted type-approval of any relevant system, component or separate technical unit specific details regarding compliance with the conformity of production requirements set out in this Annex.

3.5.   The approval authority that is granting a whole-vehicle type-approval and is not satisfied with the reported information referred to in point 3.4., and that has communicated this in writing to the relevant manufacturer and to the approval authority granting the type-approval for the system, component or separate technical unit, shall request the performance of additional conformity of production audits or checks, which shall be performed at the site of the manufacturer(s) of those systems, components or separate technical units. The results of this additional conformity of production audits or checks shall immediately be made available to that approval authority.

3.6.   Where points 3.4. and 3.5. apply and the approval authority granting the whole-vehicle type-approval has not been satisfied with the additional audit or check results, the manufacturer shall ensure that conformity of production is restored as soon as possible to the satisfaction of that approval authority and of the approval authority granting type-approval of the system, component or separate technical unit.

4.   Continued verification arrangements

4.1.   The approval authority that has granted type-approval may at any time verify the conformity control methods applied in each production facility by means of periodic audits. The manufacturer shall for that purpose allow access to that authority to the manufacturing, inspection, testing, storage and distribution sites and shall provide all necessary information with regard to the quality management system documentation and records.

4.1.1.   The normal arrangements for such periodic audits shall be to monitor the continued effectiveness of the procedures laid down in points 2 and 3 (initial assessment and product conformity arrangements).

4.1.1.1.   Surveillance activities carried out by the technical services (qualified or recognised as required in point 2.3.3) shall be accepted as satisfying the requirement of point 4.1.1 with regard to the procedures established at initial assessment.

4.1.1.2.   The normal frequency of verifications by the approval authority (other than those referred to in point 4.1.1.1) shall be such as to ensure that the relevant controls applied in accordance with points 2 and 3 are reviewed at intervals based on a risk assessment methodology that complies with the international standard ISO 31000:2018 – Risk Management – Principles and Guidelines, and such verification shall in any case be conducted at least once every three years. This methodology shall in particular take into account any non-conformity raised by other Member States in the context of Article 54(1).

4.2.   At every review, records of tests or checks and records of production, in particular records of those tests or checks documented as required in point 2.2, shall be made available to the inspector.

4.3.   The inspector may select samples at random manner to be tested in the manufacturer's laboratory or in the facilities of the technical service. In such a case only physical test shall be carried out. The minimum number of samples may be determined on the basis of the results of the manufacturer's own verification.

4.4.   The inspector who is of the opinion that the level of control is unsatisfactory, or who deems it necessary to verify the validity of the tests carried out in accordance with point 4.2, shall select samples to be sent to a technical service to perform physical tests in accordance with the requirements on conformity of production, set out in the regulatory acts listed in Annex II.

4.5.   Where unsatisfactory results are found during an inspection or a monitoring review, the approval authority shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the manufacturer restores the conformity of production as rapidly as possible.

4.6.   In cases where compliance with UN Regulations is required by this Regulation, the manufacturer may choose to apply this Annex as an equivalent alternative to the conformity of production requirements in the respective UN Regulations. However, if points 4.4. or 4.5. apply, all separate conformity of production requirements in the UN Regulations have to be complied with to the satisfaction of the approval authority until it decides that conformity of production has been restored.

ANNEX IX

PROCEDURES TO BE FOLLOWED DURING MULTI-STAGE TYPE-APPROVAL

1.   Obligations of manufacturers

1.1.   The satisfactory operation of the multi-stage type-approval requires joint action by all the manufacturers concerned. To that end approval authorities must ensure, before granting first and subsequent stage type-approvals, that suitable arrangements exist between the relevant manufacturers for the supply and interchange of documents and information, so that the completed type of vehicle meets the technical requirements of all the relevant regulatory acts listed in Annex II. Such information must include details of relevant system, component and separate technical unit type-approvals and of vehicle parts that form part of the incomplete vehicle but have not yet been type-approved.

1.2.   Each manufacturer involved in a multi-stage type-approval shall be responsible for the approval and conformity of production of all systems, components or separate technical units manufactured or added by that manufacturer to the previously built stage. The manufacturer of the subsequent stage shall not be responsible for objects that have been approved in an earlier stage, except where that manufacturer modifies relevant parts to such an extent that the previously granted type-approval becomes invalid.

2.   Obligations of approval authorities

2.1.   The approval authority shall:

(a)

verify that all EU type-approval certificates issued pursuant to the regulatory acts that are applicable for vehicle type-approval cover the type of vehicle at its state of completion and correspond to the prescribed requirements;

(b)

ensure that all the relevant data, taking account of the state of completion of the vehicle, is included in the information folder;

(c)

by reference to the documentation ensure that the vehicle specification(s) and data contained in the information folder are included in the data in the information packages and in the EU type-approval certificates issued in accordance with the relevant regulatory acts; and in the case of a completed vehicle, where an item number of the information folder is not included in the information package of any of the regulatory acts, confirm that the relevant part or characteristic conforms to the particulars in the information folder;

(d)

on a selected sample of vehicles from the type to be approved carry out or arrange to be carried out inspections of vehicle parts and systems to verify that the vehicle(s) is/are built in accordance with the relevant data contained in the authenticated information package in accordance with all relevant regulatory acts; and

(e)

where required carry out, or arrange to be carried out, relevant installation checks for separate technical units.

2.2.   The number of vehicles to be inspected for the purposes of point 2.1 (d) shall be sufficient to permit the proper control of the various combinations to be EU type-approved according to the state of completion of the vehicle and the following criteria:

—

engine;

—

gearbox;

—

powered axles (number, position, interconnection);

—

steered axles (number and position);

—

body styles;

—

number of doors;

—

hand of drive;

—

number of seats;

—

level of equipment.

3.   Applicable requirements

3.1.   Multi-stage type-approvals shall be granted on the basis of the state of completion of the type of vehicle and shall incorporate all type-approvals granted at earlier stages.

3.2.   For the whole-vehicle type-approval, this Regulation (in particular the requirements of Annex I and the particular regulatory acts listed in Annex II) shall apply in the same manner as if the approval would have been granted (or extended) to the manufacturer of the base vehicle.

3.2.1.   Where a type of system, component or separate technical unit has not been modified, the system, component or separate technical unit type-approval granted in the previous stage shall remain valid until the expiration date for the first registration, as specified in the particular regulatory act.

3.2.2.   Where a type of system has been modified at the subsequent stage of completion of the vehicle, to the extent that the system has to be retested for type-approval purposes, that retesting shall be limited to only those parts of the system that have been modified or affected by the changes.

3.2.3.   Where a type of vehicle or a type of system has been modified by another manufacturer at the subsequent stage of completion of the vehicle, to the extent that, apart from the manufacturers name, the vehicle or system may still be considered as the same type, the requirement applying to existing types may still be applied as long as the date for first registration in the relevant regulatory act has not been reached.

3.2.4.   The change of category of a vehicle shall lead to the application of the relevant requirements to the new category of vehicle. The EU type-approval certificates from the previous category shall be accepted provided that the vehicle complies with the same requirements as, or more stringent than, those applying to the new category.

3.3.   Subject to the agreement of the approval authority, a whole-vehicle type-approval granted to the manufacturer of the subsequent stage of completion of the vehicle does not need to be extended or revised where an extension given at the previous stage vehicle does not affect the subsequent stage or the technical data of the vehicle. However, the type-approval number including the extension of the previous stage(s) vehicle shall be copied in the certificate of conformity of the subsequent stage vehicle.

3.4.   Where the cargo area of a complete or completed vehicle of category N or O is modified by another manufacturer for the addition of removable fittings to store and secure the cargo (for example, load space lining, storage racks and roof racks), such items can be treated as part of the pay-mass and a type-approval is not needed, provided both of the following conditions are met:

(a)

the modifications do not affect the vehicle's type-approval in any way, other than an increase of the actual mass of the vehicle;

(b)

the added fittings can be removed without using special tools.

4.   Identification of the vehicle

4.1.   The VIN, prescribed by Regulation (EU) No 19/2011, shall be retained during all the subsequent stages of the type-approval to ensure the traceability of the process.

4.2.   At the second and subsequent stages, in addition to the statutory plate prescribed by Regulation (EU) No 19/2011, each manufacturer shall affix to the vehicle an additional plate the model of which is shown in the Appendix to this Annex. This plate shall be firmly attached, in a conspicuous and readily accessible position on a part not subject to replacement in use. It shall clearly and indelibly show the following information in the order listed:

—

the name of the manufacturer;

—

sections 1, 3 and 4 of the EU type-approval number;

—

the stage of approval;

—

the VIN of the base vehicle;

—

the technically permissible maximum laden mass of the vehicle where the value has changed during the current stage of approval;

—

the technically permissible maximum laden mass of the combination (where the value has changed during the current stage of approval and where the vehicle is permitted to tow a trailer). ‘0’ shall be used if the vehicle is not permitted to tow a trailer;

—

the technically permissible maximum mass on each axle, listed in order from front to rear where the value has changed during the current stage of approval;

—

in the case of a semi-trailer or centre axle trailer, the technically permissible maximum mass at the coupling point where the value has changed during the current stage of approval.

Unless otherwise provided for in point 4.1 and this point the additional plate shall comply with the requirements set out in Annex I and Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 19/2011.
