DIRECTIVE 2014/68/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 15 May 2014

on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market of pressure equipment

(recast)

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee

(

1

)

,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure

(

2

)

,

Whereas:

(1)

Directive 97/23/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

3

)

has been substantially amended

(

4

)

. Since further amendments are to be made, that Directive should be recast in the interests of clarity.

(2)

Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

5

)

lays down rules on the accreditation of conformity assessment bodies, provides a framework for the market surveillance of products and for controls on products from third countries, and lays down the general principles of the CE marking.

(3)

Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

6

)

lays down common principles and reference provisions intended to apply across sectoral legislation in order to provide a coherent basis for revision or recasts of that legislation. Directive 97/23/EC should therefore be adapted to that Decision.

(4)

This Directive covers pressure equipment and assemblies which are new to the Union market when they are placed on the market; that is to say they are either new pressure equipment or assemblies made by a manufacturer established in the Union or pressure equipment or assemblies, whether new or second-hand, imported from a third country.

(5)

This Directive should apply to all forms of supply, including distance selling.

(6)

This Directive should apply to pressure equipment subject to a maximum allowable pressure PS greater than 0,5 bar. Pressure equipment subject to a pressure of not more than 0,5 bar does not pose a significant risk due to pressure. Therefore, there should not be any obstacle to its free movement within the Union.

(7)

This Directive should also apply to assemblies composed of several pieces of pressure equipment assembled to constitute an integrated and functional whole. Those assemblies may range from simple assemblies such as pressure cookers to complex assemblies such as water tube boilers. If the manufacturer of an assembly intends to place it on the market and put it into service as an assembly — and not in the form of its constituent non-assembled elements — that assembly should comply with this Directive. However, this Directive should not apply to the assembly of pressure equipment on the site and under the responsibility of a user who is not the manufacturer, as in the case of industrial installations.

(8)

This Directive should harmonise national provisions on risks due to pressure. The other risks which this equipment may present may fall within the scope of other Directives dealing with those risks.

(9)

However, some pressure equipment is covered by other Directives based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The provisions laid down in some of those Directives deal also with the risk due to pressure. Those Directives are considered adequate to provide appropriate protection where the risk due to pressure associated with such equipment remains small. Therefore, such equipment should be excluded from the scope of this Directive.

(10)

For some pressure equipment covered by international agreements for its international transport, national transport and pressure hazards and risks are dealt with by Union Directives based on such agreements. Those Directives extend the application of those agreements to national transport, in order to ensure the free movement of dangerous goods whilst enhancing transport safety. Such equipment which is covered by Directive 2008/68/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

7

)

and by Directive 2010/35/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

8

)

should be excluded from the scope of this Directive.

(11)

Certain types of pressure equipment, although subject to a maximum allowable pressure PS greater than 0,5 bar, do not present any significant risk due to pressure, and therefore the free movement of such equipment in the Union should not be hindered if it has been legally manufactured or placed on the market in a Member State. It is not necessary in order to ensure free movement of such equipment to include it within the scope of this Directive. Consequently it should be expressly excluded from its scope.

(12)

Other pressure equipment subject to a maximum allowable pressure greater than 0,5 bar and presenting a significant risk due to pressure, but in respect of which free movement and an appropriate level of safety are guaranteed, should be excluded from the scope of this Directive. Such exclusions should, however, be regularly reviewed in order to ascertain whether it is necessary to take action at Union level.

(13)

The scope of this Directive should be based on a general definition of the term ‘pressure equipment’ so as to allow for the technical development of products.

(14)

Compliance with the essential safety requirements is necessary in order to ensure the safety of pressure equipment. Those requirements should be subdivided into general and specific requirements that need to be met by pressure equipment. In particular the specific requirements should take account of particular types of pressure equipment. Certain types of pressure equipment in categories III and IV should be subject to a final assessment comprising final inspection and proof tests.

(15)

Member States should be in a position to allow the showing at trade fairs of pressure equipment which is not yet in conformity with the requirements of this Directive. During demonstrations, appropriate safety measures should be taken in accordance with the general safety rules of the Member State concerned to ensure the safety of persons.

(16)

Directive 97/23/EC provides for a classification of pressure equipment in categories, according to the ascending level of hazard. This includes the classification of the fluid contained in the pressure equipment as dangerous or not, according to Council Directive 67/548/EEC

(

9

)

. On 1 June 2015 Directive 67/548/EEC is to be repealed and replaced by Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

10

)

, which implements in the Union the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals that has been adopted at international level, within the United Nations structure. Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 introduces new hazard classes and categories only partially corresponding to those provided for by Directive 67/548/EEC. Directive 97/23/EC should therefore be aligned to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 while maintaining the existing levels of protection provided for in that Directive.

(17)

Economic operators should be responsible for the compliance of pressure equipment and assemblies with the requirements of this Directive, in relation to their respective roles in the supply chain, so as to ensure a high level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety of persons, and the protection of domestic animals and of property, and to guarantee fair competition on the Union market.

(18)

All economic operators intervening in the supply and distribution chain should take appropriate measures to ensure that they only make available on the market pressure equipment and assemblies which are in conformity with this Directive. It is necessary to provide for a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations which correspond to the role of each economic operator in the supply and distribution chain.

(19)

The manufacturer, having detailed knowledge of the design and production process, is best placed to carry out the conformity assessment procedure. Conformity assessment should therefore remain solely the obligation of the manufacturer.

(20)

In order to facilitate the communication between economic operators, market surveillance authorities and consumers, Member States should encourage economic operators to include a website address in addition to the postal address.

(21)

It is necessary to ensure that pressure equipment and assemblies from third countries entering the Union market comply with the requirements of this Directive, and in particular that appropriate conformity assessment procedures have been carried out by manufacturers with regard to that pressure equipment or those assemblies. Provision should therefore be made for importers to make sure that the pressure equipment or assembly they place on the market complies with the requirements of this Directive and that they do not place on the market pressure equipment or assemblies which do not comply with such requirements or presents a risk. Provision should also be made for importers to make sure that the conformity assessment procedures have been carried out and that marking of pressure equipment or assemblies and documentation drawn up by manufacturers are available for inspection by the competent national authorities.

(22)

When placing pressure equipment or assemblies on the market, every importer should indicate on the pressure equipment or assembly his name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which he can be contacted. Exceptions should be provided for in cases where the size or nature of the pressure equipment or assembly does not allow it. This includes cases where the importer would have to open the packaging to put his name and address on the pressure equipment or assembly.

(23)

The distributor makes pressure equipment or assemblies available on the market after they have been placed on the market by the manufacturer or the importer and should act with due care to ensure that its handling of the pressure equipment or assembly does not adversely affect the compliance of the pressure equipment or assembly with the requirements of this Directive.

(24)

Any economic operator that either places pressure equipment or assemblies on the market under his own name or trademark or modifies pressure equipment or assemblies in such a way that compliance with the requirements of this Directive may be affected should be considered to be the manufacturer and should assume the obligations of the manufacturer.

(25)

Distributors and importers, being close to the market place, should be involved in market surveillance tasks carried out by the competent national authorities, and should be prepared to participate actively, providing those authorities with all necessary information relating to the pressure equipment or assembly concerned.

(26)

Ensuring traceability of pressure equipment and assemblies throughout the whole supply chain helps to make market surveillance simpler and more efficient. An efficient traceability system facilitates market surveillance authorities’ task of tracing economic operators who made non-compliant pressure equipment or assemblies available on the market.

(27)

When keeping the information required under this Directive for the identification of other economic operators, economic operators should not be required to update such information in respect of other economic operators who have either supplied them with pressure equipment or an assembly or to whom they have supplied pressure equipment or an assembly.

(28)

This Directive should be limited to the expression of the essential safety requirements. In order to facilitate conformity assessment with those requirements it is necessary to provide for a presumption of conformity for pressure equipment or assemblies which are in conformity with harmonised standards that are adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

11

)

for the purpose of expressing detailed technical specifications of those requirements, especially with regard to the design, manufacture and testing of pressure equipment or assemblies.

(29)

Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 provides for a procedure for objections to harmonised standards where those standards do not entirely satisfy the requirements of this Directive.

(30)

Manufacturing of pressure equipment calls for the utilisation of safe materials. In the absence of harmonised standards the characteristics of the materials intended for repeated use should be established. Those characteristics should be established by European approvals for materials, such approvals being issued by one of the notified bodies specifically designated for that task. The materials conforming to the European approvals should benefit from a presumption of conformity with the essential safety requirements of this Directive.

(31)

In view of the nature of the risks involved in the use of pressure equipment and assemblies and in order to enable economic operators to demonstrate and the competent authorities to ensure that pressure equipment or assemblies made available on the market comply with the essential safety requirements, it is necessary to provide for conformity assessment procedures. Those procedures should be devised in the light of the level of hazard which is inherent in the pressure equipment or assembly. Therefore, for each category of pressure equipment there should be an adequate procedure or a choice between different procedures of equivalent stringency. Decision No 768/2008/EC establishes modules for conformity assessment procedures, which include procedures from the least to the most stringent, in proportion to the level of risk involved and the level of safety required. In order to ensure inter-sectoral coherence and to avoid ad-hoc variants, conformity assessment procedures should be chosen from among those modules. The details added to those procedures are justified by the nature of the verification required for pressure equipment.

(32)

Member States should be in a position to authorise user inspectorates to carry out certain tasks for conformity assessment in the framework of this Directive. For that purpose this Directive should set out criteria for the authorisation of user inspectorates by Member States.

(33)

Under certain procedures for conformity assessment it should be possible for each item to be inspected and tested by a notified body or a user inspectorate as part of the final assessment of the pressure equipment or assembly. In other cases provision should be made to ensure that the final assessment may be monitored by a notified body by means of unexpected visits.

(34)

Manufacturers should draw up an EU declaration of conformity to provide information required under this Directive on the conformity of the pressure equipment or assembly with the requirements of this Directive and of other relevant Union harmonisation legislation.

(35)

To ensure effective access to information for market surveillance purposes, in cases where pressure equipment or an assembly is covered by several pieces of Union harmonisation legislation, the information required to identify all applicable Union acts should be available in a single EU declaration of conformity. In order to reduce the administrative burden on economic operators, that single EU declaration of conformity may be a dossier made up of relevant individual declarations of conformity.

(36)

A check on compliance with the essential safety requirements is necessary in order to provide effective protection for consumers, other users and third parties.

(37)

Pressure equipment and assemblies should, as a general rule, bear the CE marking. The CE marking, indicating the conformity of pressure equipment or assemblies, is the visible consequence of a whole process comprising conformity assessment in a broad sense. General principles governing the CE marking and its relationship to other markings are set out in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Rules governing the affixing of the CE marking should be laid down in this Directive.

(38)

For pressure equipment defined in this Directive which presents only a minor pressure risk and for which certification procedures are therefore not justified, the CE marking should not be affixed.

(39)

Certain conformity assessment procedures set out in this Directive require the intervention of conformity assessment bodies, which are notified by the Member States to the Commission.

(40)

Experience has shown that the criteria set out in Directive 97/23/EC that conformity assessment bodies have to fulfil to be notified to the Commission are not sufficient to ensure a uniformly high level of performance of those bodies throughout the Union. It is, however, essential that all conformity assessment bodies perform their functions to the same level and under conditions of fair competition. That requires the setting of obligatory requirements for conformity assessment bodies wishing to be notified in order to provide conformity assessment services.

(41)

If a conformity assessment body demonstrates conformity with the criteria laid down in harmonised standards, it should be presumed to comply with the corresponding requirements set out in this Directive.

(42)

In order to ensure a consistent level of conformity assessment quality, it is also necessary to set requirements for notifying authorities and other bodies involved in the assessment, notification and monitoring of conformity assessment bodies.

(43)

The system set out in this Directive should be complemented by the accreditation system provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Since accreditation is an essential means of verifying the competence of conformity assessment bodies, it should also be used for the purposes of notification.

(44)

Transparent accreditation as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, ensuring the necessary level of confidence in certificates of conformity, should be considered by the national public authorities throughout the Union as the preferred means of demonstrating the technical competence of conformity assessment bodies. However, national authorities may consider that they possess the appropriate means of carrying out that evaluation themselves. In such cases, in order to ensure the appropriate level of credibility of evaluations carried out by other national authorities, they should provide the Commission and the other Member States with the necessary documentary evidence demonstrating the compliance of the conformity assessment bodies evaluated with the relevant regulatory requirements.

(45)

Conformity assessment bodies frequently subcontract parts of their activities linked to the assessment of conformity or have recourse to a subsidiary. In order to safeguard the level of protection required for the pressure equipment or assembly to be placed on the Union market, it is essential that conformity assessment subcontractors and subsidiaries fulfil the same requirements as notified bodies in relation to the performance of conformity assessment tasks. Therefore, it is important that the assessment of the competence and the performance of bodies to be notified and the monitoring of bodies already notified cover also activities carried out by subcontractors and subsidiaries.

(46)

It is necessary to increase the efficiency and transparency of the notification procedure and, in particular, to adapt it to new technologies so as to enable online notification.

(47)

Since conformity assessment bodies may offer their services throughout the Union, it is appropriate to give the other Member States and the Commission the opportunity to raise objections concerning a notified body. It is therefore important to provide for a period during which any doubts or concerns as to the competence of conformity assessment bodies can be clarified before they start operating as notified bodies.

(48)

In the interests of competitiveness, it is crucial that conformity assessment bodies apply the conformity assessment procedures without creating unnecessary burdens for economic operators. For the same reason, and to ensure equal treatment of economic operators, consistency in the technical application of the conformity assessment procedures needs to be ensured. That can best be achieved through appropriate coordination and cooperation between conformity assessment bodies.

(49)

Member States should take all appropriate measures to ensure that pressure equipment and assemblies may be placed on the market only if, when properly stored and used for their intended purpose, or under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, they do not endanger the health and safety of persons. Pressure equipment or assemblies should be considered as non-compliant with the essential safety requirements laid down in this Directive only under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, that is when such use could result from lawful and readily predictable human behaviour.

(50)

In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred to the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

12

)

.

(51)

The advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts requesting the notifying Member State to take the necessary corrective measures in respect of notified bodies that do not meet or no longer meet the requirements for their notification.

(52)

The examination procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts with respect to European approvals for materials presenting shortcomings and whose references were already published in the

Official Journal of the European Union

, given that such decisions could have consequences on the presumption of conformity with the applicable essential requirements.

(53)

The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to compliant pressure equipment or assemblies which present a risk to the health or safety of persons, to domestic animals or to property, imperative grounds of urgency so require.

(54)

In line with established practice, the committee set up by this Directive can play a useful role in examining matters concerning the application of this Directive raised either by its chair or by a representative of a Member State in accordance with its rules of procedure.

(55)

When matters relating to this Directive, other than its implementation or infringements, are being examined, i.e. in a Commission expert group, the European Parliament should in line with existing practice receive full information and documentation and, where appropriate, an invitation to attend such meetings.

(56)

The Commission should, by means of implementing acts and, given their special nature, acting without the application of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, determine whether measures taken by Member States in respect of non-compliant pressure equipment or assemblies are justified or not.

(57)

In order to take into account emerging very serious safety reasons, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amendments to classification of pressure equipment or assemblies. The reclassification should be based on appropriate evidence and justification in each case. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level.

(58)

The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.

(59)

Directive 97/23/EC provides for a transitional arrangement enabling pressure equipment and assemblies which comply with the national regulations in force on the date of application of Directive 97/23/EC to be put into service. For reasons of legal certainty, it is necessary to include that transitional arrangement also in this Directive.

(60)

It is necessary to provide for reasonable transitional arrangements that allow the making available on the market and the putting into service, without the need to comply with further product requirements, of pressure equipment and assemblies that have already been placed on the market in accordance with Directive 97/23/EC before the date of application of national measures transposing this Directive. Distributors should therefore be able to supply pressure equipment and assemblies that have been placed on the market, namely stock that is already in the distribution chain, before the date of application of national measures transposing this Directive.

(61)

Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of national law adopted pursuant to this Directive and ensure that those rules are enforced. The penalties provided for should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

(62)

Since the objective of this Directive, namely to ensure that pressure equipment or assemblies on the market fulfil the requirements providing a high level of protection of health and safety of persons and protection of domestic animals or property while guaranteeing the functioning of the internal market cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.

(63)

The obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive amendment as compared to the earlier Directive. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under the earlier Directive.

(64)

This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limit for transposition into national law and the date of application of the Directive set out in Annex V, Part B,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

CHAPTER 5

UNION MARKET SURVEILLANCE, CONTROL OF PRESSURE EQUIPMENT AND ASSEMBLIES ENTERING THE UNION MARKET, AND UNION SAFEGUARD PROCEDURE

Article 39

Union market surveillance and control of pressure equipment and assemblies entering the Union market

Article 15(3) and Articles 16 to 29 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 shall apply to pressure equipment and assemblies covered by Article 1 of this Directive.

Article 40

Procedure for dealing with pressure equipment or assemblies presenting a risk at national level

1.   Where the market surveillance authorities of one Member State have sufficient reasons to believe that pressure equipment or assemblies covered by this Directive present a risk to the health or safety of persons or to domestic animals or property, they shall carry out an evaluation in relation to the pressure equipment or assembly concerned covering all relevant requirements laid down in this Directive. The relevant economic operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authorities for that purpose.

Where, in the course of the evaluation referred to in the first subparagraph, the market surveillance authorities find that the equipment or assembly does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Directive, they shall without delay require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate corrective actions to bring the pressure equipment or assembly into compliance with those requirements, to withdraw the equipment or assembly from the market, or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as they may prescribe.

The market surveillance authorities shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly.

Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 shall apply to the measures referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph.

2.   Where the market surveillance authorities consider that non-compliance is not restricted to their national territory, they shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which they have required the economic operator to take.

3.   The economic operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the pressure equipment and assemblies concerned that it has made available on the market throughout the Union.

4.   Where the relevant economic operator does not take adequate corrective action within the period referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, the market surveillance authorities shall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict the equipment’s or assembly’s being made available on their national market, to withdraw the equipment or assembly from that market or to recall it.

The market surveillance authorities shall inform the Commission and the other Member States, without delay, of those measures.

5.   The information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4 shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant equipment or assembly, the origin of the equipment or assembly, the nature of the non-compliance alleged and the risk involved, the nature and duration of the national measures taken and the arguments put forward by the relevant economic operator. In particular, the market surveillance authorities shall indicate whether the non-compliance is due to either of the following:

(a)

failure of the equipment or assembly to meet requirements relating to the health or safety of persons or to the protection of domestic animals or property; or

(b)

shortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in Article 12 conferring a presumption of conformity.

6.   Member States other than the Member State initiating the procedure under this Article shall without delay inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the equipment or assembly concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the adopted national measure, of their objections.

7.   Where, within three months of receipt of the information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a Member State, that measure shall be deemed justified.

8.   Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures, such as withdrawal of the equipment or assembly from the market, are taken in respect of the equipment or assembly concerned without delay.

Article 41

Union safeguard procedure

1.   Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 40(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State, or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union legislation, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act determining whether the national measure is justified or not.

The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators.

2.   If the national measure is considered justified, all Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the non-compliant equipment or assembly is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw that measure.

3.   Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the equipment or assembly is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in point (b) of Article 40(5) of this Directive, the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.

Article 42

Compliant pressure equipment or assemblies which present a risk

1.   Where, having carried out an evaluation under Article 40(1), a Member State finds that although pressure equipment or an assembly is in compliance with this Directive, it presents a risk to the health or safety of persons, to domestic animals or property, it shall require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the equipment or assembly concerned, when placed on the market, no longer presents that risk, to withdraw the equipment or assembly from the market or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as it may prescribe.

2.   The economic operator shall ensure that corrective action is taken in respect of all the equipment or assemblies concerned that he has made available on the market throughout the Union.

3.   The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the equipment or assembly concerned, the origin and the supply chain of the equipment or assembly, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken.

4.   The Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide by means of implementing acts whether the national measure is justified or not and, where necessary, propose appropriate measures.

The implementing acts referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 44(3).

On duly justified imperative grounds of urgency relating to the protection of health and safety of persons, or of domestic animals or of property, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 44(4).

5.   The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators.

Article 43

Formal non-compliance

1.   Without prejudice to Article 40, where a Member State makes one of the following findings, it shall require the relevant economic operator to put an end to the non-compliance concerned:

ANNEX I

ESSENTIAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS

1.

The obligations arising from the essential safety requirements listed in this Annex for pressure equipment also apply to assemblies where the corresponding hazard exists.

2.

The essential safety requirements laid down in this Directive are compulsory. The obligations following from those essential safety requirements apply only if the corresponding hazard exists for the pressure equipment in question when it is used under conditions which are reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer.

3.

The manufacturer is under an obligation to analyse the hazards and risks in order to identify those which apply to his equipment on account of pressure; he shall then design and construct it taking account of his analysis.

4.

The essential safety requirements are to be interpreted and applied in such a way as to take account of the state of the art and current practice at the time of design and manufacture as well as of technical and economic considerations which are consistent with a high degree of health and safety protection.

1.   GENERAL

1.1.

Pressure equipment shall be designed, manufactured and checked, and if applicable equipped and installed, in such a way as to ensure its safety when put into service in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, or in reasonably foreseeable conditions.

1.2.

In choosing the most appropriate solutions, the manufacturer shall apply the principles set out below in the following order:

—

eliminate or reduce hazards as far as is reasonably practicable;

—

apply appropriate protection measures against hazards which cannot be eliminated;

—

where appropriate, inform users of residual hazards and indicate whether it is necessary to take appropriate special measures to reduce the risks at the time of installation and/or use.

1.3.

Where the potential for misuse is known or can be clearly foreseen, the pressure equipment shall be designed to prevent risks from such misuse or, if that is not possible, adequate warning given that the pressure equipment shall not be used in that way.

2.   DESIGN

2.1.

General

The pressure equipment shall be properly designed taking all relevant factors into account in order to ensure that the equipment will be safe throughout its intended life.

The design shall incorporate appropriate safety coefficients using comprehensive methods which are known to incorporate adequate safety margins against all relevant failure modes in a consistent manner.

2.2.

Design for adequate strength

2.2.1.   The pressure equipment shall be designed for loadings appropriate to its intended use and other reasonably foreseeable operating conditions. In particular, the following factors shall be taken into account:

—

internal/external pressure,

—

ambient and operational temperatures,

—

static pressure and mass of contents in operating and test conditions,

—

traffic, wind, earthquake loading,

—

reaction forces and moments which result from the supports, attachments, piping, etc.,

—

corrosion and erosion, fatigue, etc.,

—

decomposition of unstable fluids.

Various loadings which can occur at the same time shall be considered, taking into account the probability of their simultaneous occurrence.

2.2.2.   Design for adequate strength shall be based on either of the following:

—

as a general rule, a calculation method, as described in point 2.2.3, and supplemented if necessary by an experimental design method as described in point 2.2.4,

—

an experimental design method without calculation, as described in point 2.2.4, when the product of the maximum allowable pressure PS and the volume V is less than 6 000 bar·L or the product PS·DN less than 3 000 bar.

2.2.3.

Calculation method

(a)

Pressure containment and other loading aspects

The allowable stresses for pressure equipment shall be limited having regard to reasonably foreseeable failure modes under operating conditions. To this end, safety factors shall be applied to eliminate fully any uncertainty arising out of manufacture, actual operational conditions, stresses, calculation models and the properties and behaviour of the material.

These calculation methods shall provide sufficient safety margins consistent, where applicable, with the requirements of point 7.

The requirements set out above may be met by applying one of the following methods, as appropriate, if necessary as a supplement to or in combination with another method:

—

design by formula,

—

design by analysis,

—

design by fracture mechanics.

(b)

Resistance

Appropriate design calculations shall be used to establish the resistance of the pressure equipment concerned.

In particular:

—

the calculation pressures shall not be less than the maximum allowable pressures and take into account static head and dynamic fluid pressures and the decomposition of unstable fluids. Where a vessel is separated into individual pressure-containing chambers, the partition wall shall be designed on the basis of the highest possible chamber pressure relative to the lowest pressure possible in the adjoining chamber,

—

the calculation temperatures shall allow for appropriate safety margins,

—

the design shall take appropriate account of all possible combinations of temperature and pressure which might arise under reasonably foreseeable operating conditions for the equipment,

—

the maximum stresses and peak stress concentrations shall be kept within safe limits,

—

the calculation for pressure containment shall utilise the values appropriate to the properties of the material, based on documented data, having regard to the provisions set out in point 4 together with appropriate safety factors. Material characteristics to be considered, where applicable, include:

—

yield strength, 0,2 % or 1,0 % proof strength as appropriate at calculation temperature,

—

tensile strength,

—

time-dependent strength, i.e. creep strength,

—

fatigue data,

—

Young’s modulus (modulus of elasticity),

—

appropriate amount of plastic strain,

—

bending rupture energy,

—

fracture toughness.

—

appropriate joint factors shall be applied to the material properties depending, for example, on the type of non-destructive testing, the materials joined and the operating conditions envisaged,

—

the design shall take appropriate account of all reasonably foreseeable degradation mechanisms (e.g. corrosion, creep, fatigue) commensurate with the intended use of the equipment. Attention shall be drawn, in the instructions referred to in point 3.4, to particular features of the design which are relevant to the life of the equipment, for example:

—

for creep: design hours of operation at specified temperatures,

—

for fatigue: design number of cycles at specified stress levels,

—

for corrosion: design corrosion allowance.

(c)

Stability aspects

Where the calculated thickness does not allow for adequate structural stability, the necessary measures shall be taken to remedy the situation taking into account the risks from transport and handling.

2.2.4.

Experimental design method

The design of the equipment may be validated, in all or in part, by an appropriate test programme carried out on a sample representative of the equipment or the category of equipment.

The test programme shall be clearly defined prior to testing and accepted by the notified body responsible for the design conformity assessment module, where it exists.

This programme shall define test conditions and criteria for acceptance or refusal. The actual values of the essential dimensions and characteristics of the materials which constitute the equipment tested shall be measured before the test.

Where appropriate, during tests, it shall be possible to observe the critical zones of the pressure equipment with adequate instrumentation capable of registering strains and stresses with sufficient precision.

The test programme shall include:

(a)

A pressure strength test, the purpose of which is to check that, at a pressure with a defined safety margin in relation to the maximum allowable pressure, the equipment does not exhibit significant leaks or deformation exceeding a determined threshold.

The test pressure shall be determined on the basis of the differences between the values of the geometrical and material characteristics measures under test conditions and the values used for design purposes; it shall take into account the differences between the test and design temperatures;

(b)

where the risk of creep or fatigue exists, appropriate tests determined on the basis of the service conditions laid down for the equipment, for instance hold time at specified temperatures, number of cycles at specified stress-levels;

(c)

where necessary, additional tests concerning other factors referred to in point 2.2.1 such as corrosion, external damage.

2.3.

Provisions to ensure safe handling and operation

The method of operation specified for pressure equipment shall be such as to preclude any reasonably foreseeable risk in operation of the equipment. Particular attention shall be paid, where appropriate, to:

—

closures and openings,

—

dangerous discharge of pressure relief blow-off,

—

devices to prevent physical access whilst pressure or a vacuum exists,

—

surface temperature taking into consideration the intended use,

—

decomposition of unstable fluids.

In particular, pressure equipment fitted with an access door shall be equipped with an automatic or manual device enabling the user easily to ascertain that the opening will not present any risk. Furthermore, where the opening can be operated quickly, the pressure equipment shall be fitted with a device to prevent it being opened whenever the pressure or temperature of the fluid presents a risk.

2.4.

Means of examination

(a)

Pressure equipment shall be designed and constructed so that all necessary examinations to ensure safety can be carried out;

(b)

Means of determining the internal condition of the equipment shall be available, where it is necessary to ensure the continued safety of the equipment, such as access openings allowing physical access to the inside of the pressure equipment so that appropriate examinations can be carried out safely and ergonomically;

(c)

Other means of ensuring the safe condition of the pressure equipment may be applied in any of the following situations:

—

where it is too small for physical internal access,

—

where opening the pressure equipment would adversely affect the inside,

—

where the substance contained has been shown not to be harmful to the material from which the pressure equipment is made and no other internal degradation mechanisms are reasonably foreseeable.

2.5.

Means of draining and venting

Adequate means shall be provided for the draining and venting of pressure equipment where necessary:

—

to avoid harmful effects such as water hammer, vacuum collapse, corrosion and uncontrolled chemical reactions. All stages of operation and testing, particularly pressure testing, shall be considered,

—

to permit cleaning, inspection and maintenance in a safe manner.

2.6.

Corrosion or other chemical attack

Where necessary, adequate allowance or protection against corrosion or other chemical attack shall be provided, taking due account of the intended and reasonably foreseeable use.

2.7.

Wear

Where severe conditions of erosion or abrasion may arise, adequate measures shall be taken to:

—

minimise that effect by appropriate design, e.g. additional material thickness, or by the use of liners or cladding materials,

—

permit replacement of parts which are most affected,

—

draw attention, in the instructions referred to in point 3.4, to measures necessary for continued safe use.

2.8.

Assemblies

Assemblies shall be so designed that:

—

the components to be assembled together are suitable and reliable for their duty,

—

all the components are properly integrated and assembled in an appropriate manner.

2.9.

Provisions for filling and discharge

(a)

on filling:

—

overfilling or overpressurisation having regard in particular to the filling ratio and to vapour pressure at the reference temperature,

—

instability of the pressure equipment;

(b)

on discharge: the uncontrolled release of the pressurised fluid;

(c)

on filling or discharge: unsafe connection and disconnection.

2.10.

Protection against exceeding the allowable limits of pressure equipment

Where, under reasonably foreseeable conditions, the allowable limits could be exceeded, the pressure equipment shall be fitted with, or provision made for the fitting of, suitable protective devices, unless the equipment is intended to be protected by other protective devices within an assembly.

The suitable device or combination of such devices shall be determined on the basis of the particular characteristics of the equipment or assembly.

Suitable protective devices and combinations thereof comprise:

(a)

safety accessories as defined in point 4 of Article 2,

(b)

where appropriate, adequate monitoring devices such as indicators and/or alarms which enable adequate action to be taken either automatically or manually to keep the pressure equipment within the allowable limits.

2.11.

Safety accessories

2.11.1.   Safety accessories shall:

—

be so designed and constructed as to be reliable and suitable for their intended duty and take into account the maintenance and testing requirements of the devices, where applicable,

—

be independent of other functions, unless their safety function cannot be affected by such other functions,

—

comply with appropriate design principles in order to obtain suitable and reliable protection. These principles include, in particular, fail-safe modes, redundancy, diversity and self-diagnosis.

2.11.2.

Pressure limiting devices

These devices shall be so designed that the pressure will not permanently exceed the maximum allowable pressure PS; however a short duration pressure surge in keeping with the specifications laid down in point 7.3 is allowable, where appropriate.

2.11.3.

Temperature monitoring devices

These devices shall have an adequate response time on safety grounds, consistent with the measurement function.

2.12.

External fire

Where necessary, pressure equipment shall be so designed and, where appropriate, fitted with suitable accessories, or provision made for their fitting, to meet damage-limitation requirements in the event of external fire, having particular regard to its intended use.

3.   MANUFACTURING

STATEMENT OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT

The European Parliament considers that only when and insofar as implementing acts in the sense of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 are discussed in meetings of committees, can the latter be considered as ‘comitology committees’ within the meaning of Annex I to the Framework Agreement on the relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission. Meetings of committees thus fall within the scope of point 15 of the Framework Agreement when and insofar as other issues are discussed.
