REGULATION (EU) 2024/1358 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 14 May 2024

on the establishment of ‘Eurodac’ for the comparison of biometric data in order to effectively apply Regulations (EU) 2024/1351 and (EU) 2024/1350 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Directive 2001/55/EC and to identify illegally staying third-country nationals and stateless persons and on requests for the comparison with Eurodac data by Member States’ law enforcement authorities and Europol for law enforcement purposes, amending Regulations (EU) 2018/1240 and (EU) 2019/818 of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Regulation (EU) No 603/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 78(2), points (c), (d), (e) and (g), Article 79(2), point (c), Article 87(2), point (a), and Article 88(2), point (a), thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinions of the European Economic and Social Committee

(

1

)

,

Having regard to the opinions of the Committee of the Regions

(

2

)

,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure

(

3

)

,

Whereas:

(1)

A common policy on asylum, including a Common European Asylum System, is a constituent part of the Union’s objective of progressively establishing an area of freedom, security and justice open to those who, forced by circumstances, seek international protection in the Union.

(2)

For the purpose of applying Regulation (EU) 2024/1351 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

4

)

, it is necessary to establish the identity of applicants for international protection and of persons apprehended in connection with the irregular crossing of the external borders of the Member States. In order to apply that Regulation effectively, it is also desirable to allow each Member State to check whether a third-country national or stateless person found to be illegally staying on its territory has applied for international protection in another Member State.

(3)

Moreover, for the purpose of applying Regulation (EU) 2024/1351 effectively, it is necessary to clearly record in Eurodac the fact that there has been a shift of responsibility between Member States, including in cases of relocation.

(4)

In order to apply Regulation (EU) 2024/1351 effectively and to detect any secondary movements within the Union, it is also necessary to allow each Member State to check whether a third-country national or a stateless person who is found to be illegally staying on its territory or who applies for international protection has been granted international protection or humanitarian status under national law by another Member State in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2024/1350 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

5

)

or in accordance with a national resettlement scheme. For that purpose, the biometric data of persons registered for the purpose of conducting an admission procedure should be stored in Eurodac as soon as the international protection or humanitarian status under national law is granted, and no later than 72 hours thereafter.

(5)

In order to apply Regulation (EU) 2024/1350 efficiently, it is necessary to allow each Member State to check whether a third-country national or a stateless person has been granted international protection or humanitarian status under national law in accordance with that Regulation by another Member State or has been admitted to the territory of a Member State in accordance with a national resettlement scheme. In order to be able to apply the relevant grounds for refusal provided for in that Regulation within the context of a new admission procedure, Member States also need information on the conclusion of previous admission procedures and information on any decision on granting international protection or humanitarian status under national law. Furthermore, information on a decision on granting international protection or humanitarian status under national law is necessary to identify the Member State that concluded the procedure and thus enable other Member States to seek supplementary information from that Member State.

(6)

Furthermore, in order to reflect accurately the obligations Member States have under international law to conduct search and rescue operations and to provide a more accurate picture of the composition of migratory flows in the Union, it is also necessary to record in Eurodac the fact that the third-country nationals or stateless persons were disembarked following search and rescue operations, including for statistical purposes. Without prejudice to the application of Regulation (EU) 2024/1351, the recording of that fact should not result in any difference of treatment of persons registered in Eurodac upon apprehension in connection with the irregular crossing of an external border. That should be without prejudice to the rules under Union law applicable to third-country nationals or stateless persons disembarked following search and rescue operations.

(7)

Furthermore, for the purpose of supporting the asylum system by applying Regulations (EU) 2024/1351, (EU) 2024/1348

(

6

)

and (EU) 2024/1347 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

7

)

and Directive (EU) 2024/1346 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

8

)

, it is necessary to record whether, following security checks referred to in this Regulation, it appears that a person could pose a threat to internal security. That recording should be carried out by the Member State of origin. The existence of such a record in Eurodac is without prejudice to the requirement of an individual examination under Regulations (EU) 2024/1347 and (EU) 2024/1348. The record should be erased if the investigation shows that there are insufficient grounds for considering that the person concerned represents a threat to internal security.

(8)

Following the security checks referred to in this Regulation, the fact that a person could pose a threat to internal security (‘security flag’) should only be recorded in Eurodac if the person is violent or unlawfully armed or where there are clear indications that the person is involved in any of the offences referred to in Directive (EU) 2017/541 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

9

)

or in any of the offences referred to in Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA

(

10

)

. When assessing whether a person is unlawfully armed, it is necessary that a Member State determine whether the person is carrying a firearm without a valid permit or authorisation or any other type of prohibited weapon as defined under national law. When assessing whether a person is violent, it is necessary that a Member State determine whether the person has displayed behaviour that results in physical harm to other persons that would amount to a criminal offence under national law.

(9)

Council Directive 2001/55/EC

(

11

)

provides for a system of temporary protection which was activated for the first time by means of Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/382

(

12

)

in response to the war in Ukraine. Pursuant to that system of temporary protection, Member States are to register persons enjoying temporary protection on their territory. Member States are also required, inter alia, to reunite family members and to cooperate with each other with regard to the transferral of the residence of persons enjoying temporary protection from one Member State to another. It is appropriate to supplement the data collection provisions in Directive 2001/55/EC by including persons enjoying temporary protection in Eurodac. In that regard, biometric data are an important element in establishing such persons’ identity or family relationships, and thus protecting a substantial public interest within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

13

)

. Moreover, by including the biometric data of beneficiaries of temporary protection in Eurodac rather than in a peer-to-peer system between Member States, such persons will benefit from the safeguards and protections laid down in this Regulation, in particular with regard to data retention periods, which should be as short as possible.

(10)

However, in view of the fact that a platform has already been set up by the Commission, in cooperation with the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA), established by Regulation (EU) 2018/1726 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

14

)

, and the Member States, to deal with the information exchanges necessary pursuant to Directive 2001/55/EC, it is appropriate to exclude from Eurodac persons enjoying temporary protection pursuant to Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/382 and any other equivalent national protection pursuant thereto. Such exclusion should also apply in respect of any future amendments to Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/382 and any extensions of that temporary protection.

(11)

It is appropriate to defer the collection and transmission of biometric data of third-country nationals or stateless persons registered as a beneficiary of temporary protection to three years after the entry into application of the other provisions of this Regulation, in order to ensure sufficient time for the Commission to assess the functioning and the operational efficiency of any IT system used to exchange the data of beneficiaries of temporary protection and the expected impact of such collection and transmission in the event that Directive 2001/55/EC is activated.

(12)

Biometrics constitute an important element in establishing the exact identity of the persons falling under the scope of this Regulation because they ensure a high level of accuracy of identification. Therefore, it is necessary to set up a system for the comparison of such persons’ biometric data.

(13)

It is also necessary to ensure that the system for the comparison of biometric data functions within the interoperability framework established by Regulations (EU) 2019/817

(

15

)

and (EU) 2019/818

(

16

)

of the European Parliament and of the Council in accordance with this Regulation and with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular with the principles of necessity and proportionality and with the principle of purpose limitation set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

(14)

The reuse by Member States of the biometric data of third-country nationals or stateless persons that have already been taken pursuant to this Regulation for the purposes of transmission to Eurodac in accordance with the conditions set out in this Regulation should be encouraged.

(15)

Furthermore, it is necessary to introduce provisions that frame the access of European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS) national units and of competent visa authorities to Eurodac in accordance with Regulations (EU) 2018/1240

(

17

)

and (EC) No 767/2008

(

18

)

of the European Parliament and of the Council, respectively.

(16)

For the purpose of assisting in the control of irregular immigration and of providing statistics to support evidence-based policy making, eu-LISA should be able to produce cross-system statistics using data from Eurodac, the Visa Information System (VIS), ETIAS and the Entry/Exit System (EES), established by Regulation (EU) 2017/2226 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

19

)

. In order to specify the content of those cross-system statistics, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

20

)

.

(17)

It is therefore necessary to set up a system known as ‘Eurodac’, consisting of a Central System and the Common Identity Repository (CIR) established by Regulation (EU) 2019/818, which will operate a computerised central database of biometric data, alphanumeric data and, where available, a scanned colour copy of an identity or travel document, as well as the electronic means of transmission between Eurodac and the Member States (the ‘Communication Infrastructure’).

(18)

In its communication of 13 May 2015 entitled ‘A European Agenda on Migration’, the Commission noted that Member States must also implement fully the rules on taking migrants’ fingerprints at the borders, and further proposed that it will also explore how more biometric identifiers, such as using facial recognition techniques through digital photos, can be used through Eurodac.

(19)

For the purpose of obtaining a high level of accuracy of identification, fingerprints should always be preferred over facial images. To that end, Member States should exhaust all avenues for ensuring that fingerprints can be taken from the data subject before carrying out a comparison using exclusively a facial image. To assist Member States in overcoming challenges, where it is impossible to take the fingerprints of the third-country national or stateless person because his or her fingertips are damaged, whether intentionally or not, or amputated, this Regulation should allow Member States to carry out a comparison using a facial image without taking fingerprints.

(20)

The return of third-country nationals or stateless persons who do not have a right to stay in the Union, in accordance with fundamental rights as a general principle of Union law, as well as international law, including refugee protection, the principle of non-refoulement and human rights obligations, and in compliance with Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

21

)

, is an important part of the comprehensive efforts to address migration in a fair and efficient way and, in particular, to reduce and deter irregular immigration. An increase in the effectiveness of the Union system to return illegally staying third-country nationals or stateless persons is necessary in order to maintain public trust in the Union migration and asylum system, and should go hand in hand with efforts to protect those in need of protection.

(21)

For that purpose, it is also necessary to clearly record in Eurodac the fact that an application for international protection has been rejected where the third-country national or stateless person has no right to remain and has not been allowed to remain in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2024/1348.

(22)

National authorities in the Member States experience difficulties in identifying illegally staying third-country nationals or stateless persons with a view to their return and readmission. It is therefore essential to ensure that data on third-country nationals or stateless persons who are staying illegally in the Union are collected and transmitted to Eurodac and are also compared with data collected and transmitted for the purpose of establishing the identity of applicants for international protection and of third-country nationals or stateless persons apprehended in connection with the irregular crossing of the external borders of the Member States, in order to facilitate their identification and re-documentation, to ensure their return and readmission, and to reduce identity fraud. That collection, transmission and comparison of data should also contribute to reducing the length of the administrative procedures necessary for ensuring the return and readmission of illegally staying third-country nationals or stateless persons, including the period during which they may be kept in administrative detention awaiting removal. It should also enable the identification of third countries of transit, where the illegally staying third-country national or stateless person may be readmitted.

(23)

With a view to facilitating the procedures for the identification and the issuance of travel documents for return purposes of illegally staying third-country nationals or stateless persons, a scanned colour copy of an identity or travel document should be recorded in Eurodac, where available, along with an indication of its authenticity. If such an identity or travel document is not available, only one other available document identifying the third-country national or stateless person should be recorded in Eurodac along with an indication of its authenticity. In order to facilitate the procedures for the identification and the issuance of travel documents for return purposes of illegally staying third-country nationals or stateless persons, and in order not to populate the system with counterfeit documents, only documents validated as authentic or the authenticity of which cannot be established due to the absence of security features should be kept in the system.

(24)

In its conclusions on the future of return policy of 8 October 2015, the Council endorsed the initiative announced by the Commission to explore an extension of the scope and purpose of Eurodac to enable the use of data for return purposes. Member States should have the necessary tools at their disposal to be able to control illegal migration to the Union and to detect secondary movements within the Union and illegally staying third-country nationals and stateless persons in the Union. Therefore, the data in Eurodac should be available, subject to the conditions set out in this Regulation, for comparison by the Member States’ designated authorities.

(25)

The European Border and Coast Guard Agency, established by Regulation (EU) 2019/1896 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

22

)

, supports Member States in their efforts to better manage the external borders and control illegal immigration. The European Union Agency for Asylum, established by Regulation (EU) 2021/2303 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

23

)

, provides operational and technical assistance to Member States. Consequently, authorised users of those agencies, as well as of other agencies acting in the field of Justice and Home Affairs, should be provided with access to the central repository if such access is relevant for the implementation of their tasks in line with relevant data protection safeguards.

(26)

As members of the European Border and Coast Guard Teams and experts of the asylum support teams referred to in Regulations (EU) 2019/1896 and (EU) 2021/2303, respectively, may, upon request of the host Member State, take and transmit biometric data, adequate technological solutions should be developed to ensure that efficient and effective assistance is provided to the host Member State.

(27)

Moreover, in order for Eurodac to effectively assist in the control of irregular immigration to the Union and in the detection of secondary movements within the Union, it is necessary to allow the system to count applicants, as well as applications, by linking all datasets corresponding to one person, regardless of their category, in one sequence. Where a dataset registered in Eurodac is erased, any link to that dataset should be automatically erased.

(28)

In the fight against terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences, it is essential for law enforcement authorities to have the fullest and most up-to-date information if they are to perform their tasks. The information contained in Eurodac is necessary for the purposes of the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences as referred to in Directive (EU) 2017/541 or of other serious criminal offences as referred to in Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA. Therefore, the data in Eurodac should be available, subject to the conditions set out in this Regulation, for comparison by Member States’ designated authorities and the designated authority of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol), established by Regulation (EU) 2016/794 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

24

)

.

(29)

The powers granted to law enforcement authorities to access Eurodac should be without prejudice to the right of an applicant for international protection to have his or her application processed in due course in accordance with the relevant law. Furthermore, any subsequent follow-up after obtaining a ‘hit’ from Eurodac should also be without prejudice to that right.

(30)

In its communication to the Council and the European Parliament of 24 November 2005 on improved effectiveness, enhanced interoperability and synergies among European databases in the area of Justice and Home Affairs, the Commission outlined that authorities responsible for internal security could have access to Eurodac in well-defined cases, when there is a substantiated suspicion that the perpetrator of a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence has applied for international protection. In that communication, the Commission stated that the proportionality principle requires that Eurodac be queried for such purposes only if there is an overriding public security concern, that is, if the act committed by the criminal or terrorist to be identified is so reprehensible that it justifies querying a database that registers persons with a clean criminal record, and concluded that the threshold for authorities responsible for internal security to query Eurodac must therefore always be significantly higher than the threshold for querying criminal databases.

(31)

Moreover, Europol plays a key role with respect to cooperation between Member States’ authorities in the field of cross-border crime investigation in supporting Union-wide crime prevention, analyses and investigation. Consequently, Europol should also have access to Eurodac within the framework of its tasks and in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/794.

(32)

Requests for comparison of Eurodac data by Europol should be allowed only in specific cases, under specific circumstances and under strict conditions, in line with the principles of necessity and proportionality enshrined in Article 52(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’) and as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union (the ‘Court of Justice’)

(

25

)

.

(33)

Since Eurodac was originally established to facilitate the application of the Dublin Convention

(

26

)

, access to Eurodac for the purpose of preventing, detecting or investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences constitutes a further development to the original purpose of Eurodac. In line with Article 52(1) of the Charter, any limitation on the exercise of the fundamental right to respect for the private life of individuals whose personal data are processed in Eurodac must be provided for by law, which must be formulated with sufficient precision to allow individuals to adjust their conduct, and must protect individuals against arbitrariness and indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise. Subject to the principle of proportionality, any such limitation must be necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union.

(34)

Although the original purpose of the establishment of Eurodac did not require the possibility of requesting comparisons of data with the database on the basis of a latent fingerprint, which is the dactyloscopic trace which may be found at a crime scene, such a feature is fundamental in the field of police cooperation. The possibility to compare a latent fingerprint with the fingerprint data which is stored in Eurodac in cases where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the perpetrator or victim might fall under one of the categories covered by this Regulation would provide the Member States’ designated authorities with a very valuable tool in preventing, detecting or investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences when, for example, the only evidence available at a crime scene are latent fingerprints.

(35)

This Regulation also lays down the conditions under which requests for the comparison of biometric or alphanumeric data with Eurodac data for the purpose of preventing, detecting, or investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences should be allowed and the necessary safeguards to ensure the protection of the fundamental right to respect for the private life of individuals whose personal data are processed in Eurodac. The strictness of those conditions reflects the fact that the Eurodac database registers biometric and alphanumeric data of persons who are not presumed to have committed a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence. It is acknowledged that law enforcement authorities and Europol do not always have the biometric data of the suspect or victim whose case they are investigating, which might hamper their ability to check biometric matching databases such as Eurodac. It is important to equip law enforcement authorities and Europol with the necessary tools to prevent, detect and investigate terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences where it is necessary to do so. In order to contribute further to the investigations carried out by those authorities and Europol, searches based on alphanumeric data should be allowed in Eurodac, in particular in cases where no biometric evidence can be found but where those authorities and Europol possess evidence of the personal details or identity documents of the suspect or victim.

(36)

The expansion of the scope of and simplification of the access to Eurodac for law enforcement purposes should help Member States deal with the increasingly complicated operational situations and cases involving cross-border crimes and terrorism with a direct impact on the security situation in the Union. The conditions for access to Eurodac for the purposes of the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences should also allow the law enforcement authorities of the Member States to tackle cases of suspects using multiple identities. For that purpose, obtaining a hit during a consultation of a relevant database prior to accessing Eurodac should not prevent such access. It can also be a useful tool to respond to the threat from radicalised persons or terrorists who might have been registered in Eurodac. A broader and simpler access to Eurodac for law enforcement authorities of the Member States should, while guaranteeing full respect for fundamental rights, enable Member States to use all existing tools to ensure an area of freedom, security and justice.

(37)

With a view to ensuring equal treatment for all applicants and beneficiaries of international protection, as well as in order to ensure consistency with the current Union asylum acquis, in particular with Regulations (EU) 2024/1347, (EU) 2024/1350 and (EU) 2024/1351, this Regulation includes in its scope applicants for subsidiary protection and persons eligible for subsidiary protection.

(38)

It is also necessary that Member States promptly take and transmit the biometric data of every applicant for international protection, of every person for whom Member States intend to conduct an admission procedure in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2024/1350, of every third-country national or stateless person who is apprehended in connection with the irregular crossing of an external border of a Member State or is found to be staying illegally in a Member State, and of every person disembarked following a search and rescue operation, provided that they are at least six years of age.

(39)

The obligation to take the biometric data of illegally staying third-country nationals or stateless persons of at least six years of age does not affect Member States’ right to extend a third-country national or stateless person’s stay on their territory pursuant to Article 20(2) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement

(

27

)

.

(40)

The fact that the application for international protection follows or is made simultaneously with the apprehension of the third-country national or stateless person in connection with the irregular crossing of the external borders does not exempt Member States from registering those persons as persons apprehended in connection with the irregular crossing of the external border.

(41)

The fact that the application for international protection follows or is made simultaneously with the apprehension of the third-country national or stateless person illegally staying on the territory of Member States, does not exempt Member States from registering those persons as persons found to be illegally staying on the territory of the Member States.

(42)

The fact that the application for international protection follows or is made simultaneously with the disembarkation following a search and rescue operation of the third-country national or stateless person does not exempt Member States from registering those persons as persons disembarked following a search and rescue operation.

(43)

The fact that an application for international protection follows or is made simultaneously with the registration of the beneficiary of temporary protection does not exempt Member States from registering those persons as beneficiaries of temporary protection.

(44)

With a view to strengthening the protection of all children falling under the scope of this Regulation, including unaccompanied minors who have not applied for international protection and children who might become separated from their families, it is also necessary to take biometric data for storage in Eurodac to help establish the identity of children and to assist Member States in tracing any of their family members in, or links they might have with, another Member State, as well as in tracing missing children, including for law enforcement purposes, by complementing the existing instruments, in particular the Schengen Information System (SIS) established by Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

28

)

. Effective identification procedures will assist Member States in guaranteeing the adequate protection of children. Establishing family links is a key element in restoring family unity and must be closely linked to the determination of the best interests of the child and, eventually, the determination of a sustainable solution in accordance with national practices following a needs assessment by the competent national child protection authorities.

(45)

The official responsible for taking the biometric data of a minor should receive training so that sufficient care is taken to ensure an adequate quality of biometric data of the minor and to guarantee that the process is child friendly so that the minor, particularly a very young minor, feels safe and can readily cooperate in the process of having his or her biometric data taken.

(46)

Any minor from the age of six years old and above should be accompanied by, where present, an adult family member throughout the time when his or her biometric data are taken. The unaccompanied minor should be accompanied by a representative or, where a representative has not been designated, a person trained to safeguard the best interests of the child and his or her general wellbeing, throughout the time his or her biometric data are taken. Such a trained person should not be the official responsible for taking the biometric data, should act independently and should not receive orders either from the official or the service responsible for taking the biometric data. Such a trained person should be the person designated to provisionally act as a representative under Directive (EU) 2024/1346 where that person has been designated.

(47)

The best interests of the child should be a primary consideration for Member States when applying this Regulation. Where the requesting Member State establishes that Eurodac data pertain to a child, those data may only be used for law enforcement purposes, in particular those relating to the prevention, detection and investigation of child trafficking and other serious crimes against children, by the requesting Member State and in accordance with that Member State’s laws applicable to minors and in accordance with the obligation to give primary consideration to the best interests of the child.

(48)

It is necessary to lay down precise rules for the transmission of such biometric data and of other relevant personal data in Eurodac, their storage, their comparison with other biometric data, the transmission of the results of such comparisons and the marking and erasure of the recorded data. Such rules may be different for, and should be specifically adapted to, the situation of different categories of third-country nationals or stateless persons.

(49)

Member States should ensure the transmission of biometric data of an appropriate quality for the purposes of comparison by means of the computerised fingerprint and facial recognition system. All authorities with a right of access to Eurodac should invest in adequate training and in the necessary technological equipment. The authorities with a right of access to Eurodac should inform eu-LISA of specific difficulties encountered with regard to the quality of data in order to resolve them.

(50)

The fact that it is temporarily or permanently impossible to take or to transmit the biometric data of a person, due to, inter alia, insufficient quality of the data for appropriate comparison, technical problems, reasons linked to the protection of health or the data subject being unfit or unable to have his or her biometric data taken owing to circumstances beyond his or her control, should not adversely affect the examination of or the decision on that person’s application for international protection.

(51)

Member States should take into account the Commission Staff Working Document on Implementation of the Eurodac Regulation as regards the obligation to take fingerprints, which the Council, on 20 July 2015, invited Member States to follow. It sets out a best-practice approach to taking fingerprints. Where relevant, Member States should also take into account the Checklist to act in compliance with fundamental rights when obtaining fingerprints for Eurodac, published by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, which aims to assist them with complying with fundamental rights obligations when taking fingerprints.

(52)

Member States should inform all persons required by this Regulation to give biometric data of their obligation to do so. Member States should also explain to those persons that it is in their interests to fully and immediately cooperate with the procedure by providing their biometric data. Where a Member State’s national law lays down administrative measures that provide for the possibility of taking biometric data by means of coercion as a last resort, those measures are to fully respect the Charter. Only in duly justified circumstances and as a last resort, having exhausted other possibilities, can a proportionate degree of coercion be used to ensure the compliance of third-country nationals or stateless persons who are deemed to be vulnerable persons, and minors, with the obligation to provide biometric data.

(53)

Where detention is used in order to determine or verify a third-country national’s or stateless person’s identity, it should only be used by Member States as a means of last resort and in full respect of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and in compliance with relevant Union law, including the Charter.

(54)

Where necessary, hits should be checked by a trained fingerprint expert in order to ensure the accurate determination of responsibility under Regulation (EU) 2024/1351, the exact identification of the third-country national or stateless person and the exact identification of the criminal suspect or victim of crime whose data might be stored in Eurodac. Checks by a trained expert should be considered necessary where there is doubt as to whether the result of the comparison of the fingerprint data relates to the same person, in particular where the data corresponding to a fingerprint hit belong to a person of a different sex or where the facial image data do not correspond to the facial feature of the person whose biometric data were taken. Hits obtained from Eurodac based on facial images should also be checked by an expert trained in accordance with national practice, where the comparison is made with facial image data only. Where a fingerprint and facial image data comparison is carried out simultaneously and hits are returned for both biometric datasets, Member States should be able to check the result of the comparison of the facial image data.

(55)

Third-country nationals or stateless persons who have requested international protection in one Member State might try to request international protection in another Member State for many years to come. The maximum period during which the biometric data of third-country nationals or stateless persons who have requested international protection can be kept in Eurodac should be strictly limited to the extent necessary and should be proportionate, in line with the principle of proportionality enshrined in Article 52(1) of the Charter and as interpreted by the Court of Justice. Given that most third-country nationals or stateless persons who have stayed in the Union for several years will have obtained a settled status or even citizenship of a Member State after that period, a period of 10 years should be considered a reasonable period for the storage of biometric and alphanumeric data.

(56)

In its conclusions on Statelessness of 4 December 2015, the Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States recalled the Union’s pledge of September 2012 that all Member States were to accede to the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons done at New York on 28 September 1954 and were to consider acceding to the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness done at New York on 30 August 1961.

(57)

For the purpose of applying the grounds for refusal under Regulation (EU) 2024/1350, the biometric data of third-country nationals or stateless persons registered for the purpose of conducting an admission procedure under that Regulation should be taken, transmitted to Eurodac and compared against the data stored in Eurodac of beneficiaries of international protection, of persons who have been granted international protection or humanitarian status under national law in accordance with that Regulation, of persons who have been refused admission to a Member State on one of the grounds referred to in that Regulation, namely that there were reasonable grounds for considering that third-country national or stateless person as a danger to the community, public policy, security or public health of the Member State concerned or the ground that an alert has been issued in the SIS or in a national database of a Member State for the purpose of refusing entry, or in respect of whom that admission procedure has been discontinued because they have not given or have withdrawn their consent, and of persons who have been admitted under a national resettlement scheme. Therefore, those categories of data should be stored in Eurodac and made available for comparison.

(58)

For the purpose of applying Regulations (EU) 2024/1350 and (EU) 2024/1351, the biometric data of third-country nationals or stateless persons granted international protection or humanitarian status under national law in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2024/1350 should be stored in Eurodac for five years from the date on which they were taken. Such a period should be sufficient given the fact that the majority of such persons will have resided for several years in the Union and will have obtained a long-term resident status or even citizenship of a Member State.

(59)

Where a third-country national or a stateless person has been refused admission to a Member State on one of the grounds set out in Regulation (EU) 2024/1350, namely that there were reasonable grounds for considering that third-country national or stateless person as a danger to the community, public policy, security or public health of the Member State concerned or the ground that an alert has been issued in the SIS or in a national database of a Member State for the purpose of refusing entry, the related data should be stored for a period of three years from the date on which the negative conclusion on admission was reached. It is necessary to store such data for that length of time in order to allow other Member States conducting an admission procedure to receive information, including any information on the marking of data by other Member States, from Eurodac throughout the admission procedure, where necessary, by applying the grounds for refusal set out in Regulation (EU) 2024/1350. In addition, data on admission procedures that have previously been discontinued because the third-country nationals or stateless persons have not given or have withdrawn their consent should be stored for three years in Eurodac in order to allow the other Member States conducting an admission procedure to reach a negative conclusion, as permitted by that Regulation.

(60)

The transmission of data of persons registered for the purpose of conducting an admission procedure in Eurodac should contribute to limiting the number of Member States that exchange those persons’ personal data during a subsequent admission procedure, and should thus contribute to ensuring compliance with the principle of data minimisation.

(61)

Where a hit is received by a Member State from Eurodac that can assist that Member State in carrying out its obligations necessary for the application of the grounds for refusing admission under Regulation (EU) 2024/1350, the Member State of origin which had previously refused to admit a third-country national or a stateless person should promptly exchange supplementary information with the Member State that received the hit in accordance with the principle of sincere cooperation and subject to the principles of data protection. Such an exchange of data should allow the Member State that received the hit to reach a conclusion on the admission within the time limit set in that Regulation for concluding the admission procedure.

(62)

The obligation to take and transmit the biometric data of persons registered for the purpose of conducting an admission procedure should not apply where the Member State in question discontinues the procedure before the biometric data were taken.

(63)

With a view to successfully preventing and monitoring unauthorised movements of third-country nationals or stateless persons who do not have a right to stay in the Union and to taking the necessary measures for successfully enforcing effective return and readmission to third countries in accordance with Directive 2008/115/EC and in view of the right to protection of personal data, a period of five years should be considered necessary for the storage of biometric and alphanumeric data.

(64)

In order to support Member States in their administrative cooperation during the implementation of Directive 2001/55/EC, data of beneficiaries of temporary protection should be kept in Eurodac for a period of one year from the date of entry into force of the relevant Council Implementing Decision. The retention period should be extended every year for the duration of the temporary protection.

(65)

The storage period should be shorter in certain special situations where there is no need to keep biometric data or any other personal data for that length of time. Biometric data and all other personal data belonging to third-country nationals or stateless persons should be erased immediately and permanently once third-country nationals or stateless persons obtain citizenship of a Member State.

(66)

It is appropriate to store data relating to those data subjects whose biometric data were recorded in Eurodac upon making or registering their applications for international protection and who have been granted international protection in a Member State in order to make it possible for data recorded upon registering or making another application for international protection to be compared against the data previously recorded.

(67)

eu-LISA has been entrusted with the Commission’s tasks relating to the operational management of Eurodac in accordance with this Regulation and with certain tasks relating to the Communication Infrastructure as from 1 December 2012, the date on which eu-LISA took up its responsibilities. In addition, Europol should have observer status at the meetings of the Management Board of eu-LISA when a question in relation to the application of this Regulation concerning access to Eurodac for consultation by the Member States’ designated authorities and the Europol designated authority for the purposes of the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences is on the agenda. Europol should be able to appoint a representative to the Eurodac Advisory Group of eu-LISA.

(68)

It is necessary to lay down clearly the responsibilities of the Commission and eu-LISA as regards Eurodac and the Communication Infrastructure and the responsibilities of the Member States as regards data processing, data security, access to, and rectification of, recorded data.

(69)

It is necessary to designate the competent authorities of the Member States as well as the National Access Point through which the requests for comparison with Eurodac data are made and to keep a list of the operating units within the designated authorities that are authorised to request such comparison for the specific purposes of the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences.

(70)

It is necessary to designate and keep a list of the operating units of Europol that are authorised to request comparisons with Eurodac data through the Europol Access Point. Such units, including units dealing with trafficking in human beings, sexual abuse and sexual exploitation, in particular where victims are minors, should be authorised to request comparisons with Eurodac data through the Europol Access Point in order to support and strengthen action by Member States in preventing, detecting or investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences falling within Europol’s mandate.

(71)

Requests for comparison with data stored in Eurodac should be made by the operating units within the designated authorities to the National Access Point, through the verifying authority, and should be reasoned. The operating units within the designated authorities that are authorised to request comparisons with Eurodac data should not act as a verifying authority. The verifying authorities should act independently of the designated authorities and should be responsible for ensuring, in an independent manner, strict compliance with the conditions for access laid down in this Regulation. The verifying authorities should then forward the request, without forwarding the reasons for it, for comparison through the National Access Point to Eurodac following verification that all the conditions for access have been fulfilled. In exceptional cases of urgency where early access is necessary to respond to a specific and actual threat related to terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences, it should be possible for the verifying authority to forward the request immediately and only carry out the verification afterwards.

(72)

It should be possible for the designated authority and the verifying authority to be part of the same organisation, if permitted under national law, but the verifying authority should act independently when performing its tasks under this Regulation.

(73)

For the purpose of protecting personal data, and to exclude systematic comparisons which should be forbidden, the processing of Eurodac data should only take place in specific cases and when it is necessary for the purpose of preventing, detecting or investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences. A specific case exists, in particular, when the request for comparison is connected to a specific and concrete situation, to a specific and concrete danger associated with a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence, or to specific persons in respect of whom there are serious grounds for believing that they will commit or have committed any such offence. A specific case also exists when the request for comparison is connected to a person who is the victim of a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence. The Member States’ designated authorities and the Europol designated authority should thus only request a comparison with Eurodac when they have reasonable grounds to believe that such a comparison will provide information that will substantially assist them in preventing, detecting or investigating a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence.

(74)

In addition, access should be allowed on condition that a prior search in the national biometric databases of the Member State and in the automated fingerprinting identification systems of all other Member States under Council Decision 2008/615/JHA

(

29

)

has been conducted, unless the consultation of CIR in accordance with Article 22(2) of Regulation (EU) 2019/818 indicates that the data of the person concerned are stored in Eurodac. That condition requires the requesting Member State to conduct comparisons with the automated fingerprinting identification systems of all other Member States under Decision 2008/615/JHA which are technically available, unless that Member State can justify that there are reasonable grounds to believe that it would not lead to the establishment of the identity of the data subject. Such reasonable grounds exist, in particular, where the specific case does not present any operational or investigative link to a given Member State. That condition requires the prior legal and technical implementation of Decision 2008/615/JHA by the requesting Member State in the area of fingerprint data, as it should not be permitted to conduct a Eurodac check for law enforcement purposes where the requirements for meeting that condition have not been fulfilled. In addition to the prior check of the databases, designated authorities should also be able to conduct a simultaneous check in the VIS, provided that the conditions for a comparison with the data stored therein, as laid down in Council Decision 2008/633/JHA

(

30

)

, have been met.

(75)

For the purposes of the efficient comparison and exchange of personal data, Member States should fully implement and make use of existing international agreements and of Union law concerning the exchange of personal data already in force, in particular Decision 2008/615/JHA.

(76)

While the non-contractual liability of the Union in connection with the operation of Eurodac is governed by the relevant provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), it is necessary to lay down specific rules for the non-contractual liability of the Member States in connection with the operation of Eurodac.

(77)

Regulation (EU) 2016/679 applies to the processing of personal data by Member States carried out in application of this Regulation unless such processing is carried out by the designated or verifying competent authorities of the Member States for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences, including safeguarding against, and the prevention of, threats to public security.

(78)

National rules adopted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

31

)

apply to the processing of personal data by competent authorities of the Member States for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences pursuant to this Regulation.

(79)

Regulation (EU) 2016/794 applies to the processing of personal data by Europol for the purposes of the prevention, investigation or detection of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences pursuant to this Regulation.

(80)

The rules set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 regarding the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals, in particular their right to the protection of personal data concerning them, should be specified in this Regulation with regard to the responsibility for the processing of the data, safeguarding the rights of data subjects and supervising data protection, in particular as far as certain sectors are concerned.

(81)

A person’s right to privacy and to data protection should be safeguarded in accordance with this Regulation at all times, both with regard to access by the Member States’ authorities and by the Union’s authorised agencies to Eurodac.

(82)

Data subjects should have the right of access to, and rectification and erasure of, personal data concerning them and the right of restriction of the processing thereof. Taking into account the purposes for which the data are processed, data subjects should have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement. Those rights should be exercised pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and in accordance with the procedures set out in this Regulation, Directive (EU) 2016/680 and Regulation (EU) 2016/794 as regards the processing of personal data for law enforcement purposes pursuant to this Regulation. In relation to the processing of personal data in Eurodac by national authorities, each Member State, for reasons of legal certainty and transparency, should designate the authority which is to be considered as controller in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive (EU) 2016/680 and which should have central responsibility for the processing of data by that Member State. Each Member State should communicate the details of that authority to the Commission.

(83)

It is also important that factually incorrect data recorded in Eurodac be rectified in order to ensure that statistics produced in accordance with this Regulation are accurate.

(84)

Transfers of personal data obtained by a Member State or Europol pursuant to this Regulation from Eurodac to any third country or international organisation or private entity established in or outside the Union should be prohibited in order to ensure the right to asylum and to safeguard persons whose data are processed under this Regulation from having their data disclosed to a third country. That implies that Member States should not transfer information obtained from Eurodac concerning: the name(s); date of birth; nationality; the Member State(s) of origin, Member State of relocation or Member State of resettlement; the details of the identity or travel document; the place and date of resettlement or of the application for international protection; the reference number used by the Member State of origin; the date on which the biometric data were taken and the date on which the Member State(s) transmitted the data to Eurodac; the operator user ID; and any information relating to any transfer of the data subject under Regulation (EU) 2024/1351. That prohibition should be without prejudice to the right of Member States to transfer such data to third countries to which Regulation (EU) 2024/1351 applies, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and with the national rules adopted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2016/680, in order to ensure that Member States have the possibility of cooperating with such third countries for the purposes of this Regulation.

(85)

By way of derogation from the rule that no personal data obtained by a Member State pursuant to this Regulation should be transferred or made available to any third country, it should be possible to transfer such personal data to a third country where such a transfer is subject to strict conditions and is necessary in individual cases in order to assist with the identification of a third-country national in relation to his or her return. The transfer of any personal data should be subject to strict conditions. Where such personal data are transferred, information relating to the fact that an application for international protection has been made by that third-country national should not be disclosed to a third-country. The transfer of any personal data to third countries should be carried out in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and be conducted with the agreement of the Member State of origin. Third countries of return are often not subject to adequacy decisions adopted by the Commission under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Furthermore, the extensive efforts of the Union in cooperating with the main countries of origin of illegally staying third-country nationals subject to an obligation to return have not ensured the systematic fulfilment by such third countries of the obligation established by international law to readmit their own nationals. Readmission agreements, concluded or being negotiated by the Union or the Member States and providing for appropriate safeguards for the transfer of data to third countries pursuant to Article 46 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, cover a limited number of such third countries and the conclusion of new readmission agreements remains uncertain. In such situations, and as an exception to the requirement of an adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards, the transfer of personal data to third-country authorities pursuant to this Regulation should be allowed for the purpose of implementing the return policy of the Union, and it should be possible to use the derogation provided for in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, provided that the conditions laid down in that Regulation are met. The implementation of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, including with regard to transfers of personal data to third countries pursuant to this Regulation, is subject to monitoring by the national independent supervisory authority. Regulation (EU) 2016/679 applies with regard to the responsibility of the Member States’ authorities as controllers within the meaning of that Regulation.

(86)

Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

32

)

, and in particular Article 33 thereof concerning the confidentiality and security of processing, applies to the processing of personal data by Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies carried out in the application of this Regulation, without prejudice to Regulation (EU) 2016/794, which should apply to the processing of personal data by Europol. However, certain points should be clarified in respect of the responsibility for the processing of data and of the supervision of data protection, bearing in mind that data protection is a key factor in the successful operation of Eurodac and that data security, high technical quality and the lawfulness of consultations are essential to ensure the smooth and proper functioning of Eurodac and to facilitate the application of Regulations (EU) 2024/1351 and (EU) 2024/1350.

(87)

The data subject should be informed in particular of the purpose for which his or her data will be processed within Eurodac, including a description of the aims of Regulations (EU) 2024/1351 and (EU) 2024/1350, and of the use to which law enforcement authorities may put his or her data.

(88)

It is appropriate that national supervisory authorities established in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 monitor the lawfulness of the processing of personal data by the Member States, while the European Data Protection Supervisor, established by Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, monitors the activities of the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in relation to the processing of personal data carried out in the application of this Regulation. Those supervisory authorities and the European Data Protection Supervisor should cooperate with each other in the monitoring of the processing of personal data, including in the context of the Coordinated Supervision Committee established within the framework of the European Data Protection Board.

(89)

Member States, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should ensure that the national supervisory authorities and the European Data Protection Supervisor are able to supervise the use of and access to Eurodac data adequately.

(90)

It is appropriate to monitor and evaluate the performance of Eurodac at regular intervals, including in terms of whether the access for law enforcement purposes has led to indirect discrimination against applicants for international protection, as raised in the Commission’s evaluation of the compliance of this Regulation with the Charter. eu-LISA should submit an annual report on the activities of Eurodac to the European Parliament and to the Council.

(91)

Member States should provide for a system of effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties to sanction the unlawful processing of data recorded in Eurodac contrary to its purpose.

(92)

It is necessary that Member States be informed of the status of particular asylum procedures, with a view to facilitating the adequate application of Regulation (EU) 2024/1351.

(93)

This Regulation should be without prejudice to the application of Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

33

)

.

(94)

This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter. In particular, this Regulation seeks to ensure full respect for the protection of personal data and for the right to seek international protection, and to promote the application of Articles 8 and 18 of the Charter. This Regulation should therefore be applied accordingly.

(95)

The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and delivered opinions on 21 September 2016 and on 30 November 2020.

(96)

Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the creation of a system for the comparison of biometric data to assist the implementation of Union asylum and migration policy, cannot, by its very nature, be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.

(97)

It is appropriate to restrict the territorial scope of this Regulation so as to align it to the territorial scope of Regulation (EU) 2024/1351, with the exception of the provisions related to data collected to assist with the application of Regulation (EU) 2024/1350 under the conditions set out in this Regulation,

(98)

In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.

(99)

In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, Ireland is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

CHAPTER I

General provisions

Article 1

Purpose of ‘Eurodac’

1.   A system known as ‘Eurodac’ is hereby established. Its purpose is to:

(a)

support the asylum system, including by assisting in determining which Member State is to be responsible pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2024/1351 for examining an application for international protection registered in a Member State by a third-country national or a stateless person and by facilitating the application of that Regulation under the conditions set out in this Regulation;

(b)

assist with the application of Regulation (EU) 2024/1350 under the conditions set out in this Regulation;

(c)

assist with the control of irregular immigration to the Union, with the detection of secondary movements within the Union and with the identification of illegally staying third-country nationals and stateless persons for the purpose of determining the appropriate measures to be taken by Member States;

(d)

assist with the protection of children, including in the context of law enforcement;

(e)

lay down the conditions under which Member States’ designated authorities and the Europol designated authority may request the comparison of biometric or alphanumeric data with those stored in Eurodac for law enforcement purposes for the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences;

(f)

assist in the correct identification of persons registered in Eurodac in accordance with Article 20 of Regulation (EU) 2019/818 by storing identity data, travel document data and biometric data in the common identity repository (CIR);

(g)

support the objectives of the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) established by Regulation (EU) 2018/1240;

(h)

support the objectives of the Visa Information System (VIS) referred to in Regulation (EC) No 767/2008;

(i)

support evidence-based policy making through the production of statistics;

(j)

assist with the implementation of Directive 2001/55/EC.

2.   Without prejudice to the processing of data intended for Eurodac by the Member State of origin in databases set up under that Member State’s national law, biometric data and other personal data may be processed in Eurodac only for the purposes set out in this Regulation, in Regulations (EC) No 767/2008, (EU) 2018/1240, (EU) 2019/818, (EU) 2024/1351 and (EU) 2024/1350 and in Directive 2001/55/EC.

This Regulation fully respects human dignity and fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’), including the right to respect for private life, the right to the protection of personal data, the right to asylum and the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. In that respect, the processing of personal data in accordance with this Regulation shall not result in any discrimination against persons covered by this Regulation based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation.

A person’s right to privacy and to data protection shall be safeguarded in accordance with this Regulation, both with regard to access by the Member States’ authorities and by the Union’s authorised agencies to Eurodac.

Article 3

System architecture and basic principles

1.   Eurodac shall consist of:

(a)

a Central System composed of:

(i)

a Central Unit,

(ii)

a business continuity plan and system;

(b)

a communication infrastructure between the Central System and Member States that provides a secure and encrypted communication channel for Eurodac data (the ‘Communication Infrastructure’);

(c)

the CIR;

(d)

a secure communication infrastructure between the Central System and the central infrastructures of the European search portal and between the Central System and the CIR.

2.   The CIR shall contain the data referred to in Article 17(1), points (a) to (f), (h) and (i), Article 19(1), points (a) to (f), (h) and (i), Article 21(1), points (a) to (f), (h) and (i), Article 22(2), points (a) to (f), (h) and (i), Article 23(2), points (a) to (f), (h) and (i), Article 24, paragraph (2), points (a) to (f) and (h), and paragraph (3), point (a), and Article 26(2), points (a) to (f), (h) and (i). The remaining Eurodac data shall be stored in the Central System.

3.   The Communication Infrastructure shall use the existing ‘Secure Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations’ (TESTA) network. In order to ensure confidentiality, personal data transmitted to or from Eurodac shall be encrypted.

2.   Member States shall respect the dignity and physical integrity of the person during the fingerprinting procedure and when capturing his or her facial image.

3.   Administrative measures for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the obligation to provide biometric data set out in paragraph 1 shall be laid down in national law. Those measures shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and may include the possibility to use means of coercion as a last resort.

4.   Where all of the measures laid down in national law as referred to in paragraph 3 fail to ensure compliance by an applicant with the obligation to provide biometric data, the relevant provisions of Union law on asylum concerning non-compliance with that obligation shall apply.

5.   Without prejudice to paragraphs 3 and 4, where it is impossible to take the biometric data of a third-country national or stateless person who is deemed to be a vulnerable person due to the condition of that person’s fingertips or face, and where that person did not intentionally bring about the condition, the authorities of the Member State concerned shall not employ administrative measures for ensuring compliance with the obligation to provide biometric data.

6.   The procedure for taking biometric data shall be determined and applied in accordance with the national practice of the Member State concerned and in accordance with the safeguards laid down in the Charter and in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

Article 14

Special provisions relating to minors

1.   The biometric data of minors from the age of six shall be taken by officials trained specifically to take a minor’s biometric data in a child-friendly and child-sensitive manner and in full respect of the best interests of the child and the safeguards laid down in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.

The best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration in the application of this Regulation. In the event that there is uncertainty as to whether or not a child is under the age of six and there is no supporting proof of that child’s age, the competent authorities of the Member States shall consider that child to be under the age of six for the purposes of this Regulation.

The minor shall be accompanied by, where present, an adult family member throughout the time when his or her biometric data are taken. The unaccompanied minor shall be accompanied by a representative or, where a representative has not been designated, a person trained to safeguard the best interests of the child and his or her general wellbeing, throughout the time when his or her biometric data are taken. Such a trained person shall not be the official responsible for taking the biometric data, shall act independently and shall not receive orders either from the official or the service responsible for taking the biometric data. Such a trained person shall be the person designated to provisionally act as a representative under Directive (EU) 2024/1346, where that person has been designated.

No form of force shall be used against minors to ensure their compliance with the obligation to provide biometric data. However, where permitted by relevant Union or national law, and as a last resort, a proportionate degree of coercion may be used against minors to ensure their compliance with that obligation. When applying such a proportionate degree of coercion, Member States shall respect the dignity and physical integrity of the minor.

Where a minor, in particular an unaccompanied or separated minor, refuses to give their biometric data and there are reasonable grounds for believing that there are risks relating to safeguarding or protecting the minor, as assessed by an official trained specifically to take a minor’s biometric data, the minor shall be referred to the competent national child protection authorities, the national referral mechanisms or both.

2.   Where it is not possible to take the fingerprints or capture the facial image of a minor due to the conditions of the fingertips or face, Article 13(5) shall apply. Where the fingerprints or facial image of a minor are retaken, paragraph 1 of this Article shall apply.

3.   Eurodac data that pertain to a child under the age of 14 shall only be used for law enforcement purposes against such a child where there are grounds in addition to those referred to in Article 33(1), point (d), to consider that those data are necessary for the purpose of the prevention, detection or investigation of a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence which that child is suspected of having committed.

4.   This Regulation shall be without prejudice to the application of the conditions set out in Article 13 of Directive (EU) 2024/1346.

CHAPTER II

Applicants for international protection

Article 15

Collection and transmission of biometric data

1.   Each Member State shall take, in accordance with Article 13(2), the biometric data of every applicant for international protection of at least six years of age:

(a)

upon the registration of the application for international protection referred to in Article 27 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1348 and transmit them, as soon as possible and no later than 72 hours from that registration, together with the other data referred to in Article 17(1) of this Regulation, to Eurodac in accordance with Article 3(2) of this Regulation; or

(b)

upon the making of the application for international protection, where the application is made at external border crossing points or in transit zones by a person who does not fulfil the entry conditions set out in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/399, and transmit them, as soon as possible and no later than 72 hours after the biometric data have been taken, together with the data referred to in Article 17(1) of this Regulation, to Eurodac in accordance with Article 3(2) of this Regulation.

Non-compliance with the 72-hour time limit referred to in the first subparagraph, points (a) and (b), of this paragraph shall not relieve Member States of the obligation to take the biometric data and transmit them to Eurodac.

Upon receipt of such a request, the verifying authority shall verify whether all the conditions for requesting a comparison as referred to in Article 33 or 34, as applicable, are fulfilled.

2.   Where all the conditions for requesting a comparison as referred to in Article 33 or 34 are fulfilled, the verifying authority shall forward the request for comparison to the National Access Point or Europol Access Point, which shall forward it to Eurodac in accordance with Articles 27 and 28 for the purposes of comparison with the biometric or alphanumeric data transmitted to Eurodac pursuant to Article 15, Article 18(2) and Articles 20, 22, 23, 24 and 26.

3.   A comparison of a facial image with other facial image data in Eurodac for law enforcement purposes may be carried out as provided for in Article 28(1), if such data are available at the time the reasoned electronic request is made by the Member States’ designated authorities or the Europol designated authority.

4.   In exceptional cases of urgency where there is a need to prevent an imminent danger associated with a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence, the verifying authority may transmit the biometric or alphanumeric data to the National Access Point or Europol Access Point for comparison immediately upon receipt of a request by a designated authority and only verify

ex post

whether all the conditions for requesting a comparison as referred to in Article 33 or 34 are fulfilled, including whether an exceptional case of urgency actually existed. The

ex post

verification shall take place without undue delay after the processing of the request.

5.   Where an

ex post

verification determines that the access to Eurodac data was not justified, all the authorities that have accessed such data shall erase the information communicated from Eurodac and shall inform the verifying authority of such erasure.

Article 33

Conditions for access to Eurodac by designated authorities

1.   For law enforcement purposes, designated authorities may submit a reasoned electronic request for the comparison of biometric or alphanumeric data with the data stored in Eurodac within the scope of their powers only where all of the following conditions have been met:

(a)

a prior check has been conducted in:

(i)

national databases; and

(ii)

the automated fingerprinting identification systems of all other Member States under Decision 2008/615/JHA where comparisons are technically available, unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that a comparison with such systems would not lead to the establishment of the identity of the data subject; such reasonable grounds shall be included in the reasoned electronic request for comparison with Eurodac data sent by the designated authority to the verifying authority;

(b)

the comparison is necessary for the purpose of the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences, which means that there is an overriding public security concern which makes the searching of the database proportionate to the objective pursued;

(c)

the comparison is necessary in a specific case including specific persons; and

(d)

there are reasonable grounds to consider that the comparison will substantially contribute to the prevention, detection or investigation of any of the terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences in question; such reasonable grounds exist in particular where there is a substantiated suspicion that the suspect, perpetrator or victim of a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence falls within a category covered by this Regulation.

In addition to the prior check of the databases referred to in the first subparagraph, designated authorities may also conduct a check in the VIS, provided that the conditions for a comparison with the data stored therein, as laid down in Decision 2008/633/JHA, are met. Designated authorities may submit the reasoned electronic request referred to in the first subparagraph simultaneously with a request for comparison with the data stored in the VIS.

2.   Where the designated authorities have consulted the CIR in accordance with Article 22(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/818 and the CIR, in accordance with paragraph 2 of that Article, has indicated that the data relating to the person concerned are stored in Eurodac, the designated authorities may access Eurodac for consultation without a prior check in national databases or in the automated fingerprinting identification systems of all other Member States.

3.   Requests for comparison with Eurodac data for law enforcement purposes, shall be carried out with biometric or alphanumeric data.

(a)

comparisons with biometric or alphanumeric data stored in any information processing systems that are technically and legally accessible by Europol did not lead to the establishment of the identity of the data subject;

(b)

the comparison is necessary to support and strengthen action by Member States in preventing, detecting or investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences falling under Europol’s mandate, which means that there is an overriding public security concern which makes the searching of the database proportionate to the objective pursued;

(c)

the comparison is necessary in a specific case including specific persons; and

(d)

there are reasonable grounds to consider that the comparison will substantially contribute to the prevention, detection or investigation of any of the terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences in question; such reasonable grounds exist in particular where there is a substantiated suspicion that the suspect, perpetrator or victim of a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence falls within a category covered by this Regulation.

2.   Where Europol has consulted the CIR in accordance with Article 22(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/818 and the CIR, in accordance with paragraph 2 of that Article, has indicated that the data relating to the person concerned are stored in Eurodac, Europol may access Eurodac for consultation under the conditions provided for in this Article.

3.   Requests for comparison with Eurodac data for law enforcement purposes, shall be carried out with biometric or alphanumeric data.

As far as is necessary to ensure that the results of the comparison by Eurodac reach a very high level of accuracy, eu-LISA shall establish the appropriate quality of transmitted biometric data. Eurodac shall, as soon as possible, check the quality of the biometric data transmitted. If the biometric data do not lend themselves to comparison using the computerised fingerprint and facial recognition system, Eurodac shall inform the Member State concerned. That Member State shall then transmit biometric data of the appropriate quality using the same reference number as the previous set of biometric data.

2.   Eurodac shall carry out comparisons in the order of arrival of requests. Each request shall be handled within 24 hours of its arrival. A Member State may, for reasons connected with national law, require particularly urgent comparisons to be carried out within one hour. Where such time limits cannot be respected due to circumstances which are outside the eu-LISA’s responsibility, Eurodac shall process the request as a matter of priority as soon as those circumstances no longer prevail. In such cases, as far as is necessary for the efficient operation of Eurodac, eu-LISA shall establish criteria to ensure the priority handling of requests.

3.   As far as is necessary for the efficient operation of Eurodac, eu-LISA shall establish the operational procedures for the processing of the data received and for transmitting the result of the comparison.

4.   Where necessary, a fingerprint expert in the receiving Member State, as defined in accordance with its national rules and specifically trained in the types of fingerprint comparisons provided for in this Regulation, shall immediately check the result of the comparison of fingerprint data carried out pursuant to Article 27.

Where, following a comparison of both fingerprint and facial image data with data recorded in the computerised central database, Eurodac returns a fingerprint hit and a facial image hit, Member States may check the result of the comparison of the facial image data.

For the purposes laid down in Article 1(1), points (a), (b), (c) and (j), of this Regulation, final identification shall be made by the Member State of origin in cooperation with the other Member States concerned.

5.   The result of the comparison of facial image data carried out pursuant to Article 27, where a hit based only on a facial image is received, and Article 28 shall be immediately checked and verified in the receiving Member State by an expert trained in accordance with national practice.

For the purposes laid down in Article 1(1), points (a), (b), (c) and (j), of this Regulation, final identification shall be made by the Member State of origin in cooperation with the other Member States concerned.

Information received from Eurodac relating to other data found to be unreliable shall be erased as soon as the unreliability of the data is established.

6.   Where final identification in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 5 reveals that the result of the comparison received from Eurodac does not correspond to the biometric data sent for comparison, Member States shall immediately erase the result of the comparison and communicate that fact as soon as possible, and no later than three working days after the receipt of the result, to eu-LISA and inform it of the reference number of the Member State of origin and the reference number of the Member State that received the result.

Article 39

Communication between Member States and Eurodac

Data transmitted from the Member States to Eurodac and vice versa shall use the Communication Infrastructure. As far as is necessary for the efficient operation of Eurodac, eu-LISA shall establish the technical procedures necessary for the use of the Communication Infrastructure.

Article 40

Access to, and rectification or erasure of, data recorded in Eurodac

1.   The Member State of origin shall have access to data which it has transmitted and which are recorded in Eurodac in accordance with this Regulation.

2.   The authorities of Member States which, pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, have access to data recorded in Eurodac shall be those designated by each Member State for the purposes laid down in Article 1(1), points (a), (b), (c) and (j). That designation shall specify the exact unit responsible for carrying out tasks related to the application of this Regulation. Each Member State shall without delay communicate to the Commission and eu-LISA a list of those units and any amendments thereto. eu-LISA shall publish the consolidated list in the

Official Journal of the European Union

. Where there are amendments to that list, eu-LISA shall publish once a year an updated consolidated list online.

3.   Only the Member State of origin shall have the right to amend the data which it has transmitted to Eurodac by rectifying or supplementing such data, or to erase them, without prejudice to erasure carried out pursuant to Article 29.

4.   Access for the purpose of consulting the Eurodac data stored in the CIR shall be granted to the duly authorised staff of the national authorities of each Member State and to the duly authorised staff of the Union bodies competent for the purposes laid down in Articles 20 and 21 of Regulation (EU) 2019/818. That access shall be limited to the extent necessary for the performance of the tasks of those national authorities and Union bodies and for the achievement of those purposes and shall be proportionate to the objectives pursued.

5.   If a Member State or eu-LISA has evidence to suggest that data recorded in Eurodac are factually inaccurate, it shall, without prejudice to the notification of a personal data breach pursuant to Article 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, inform the Member State of origin thereof as soon as possible.

If a Member State has evidence to suggest that data were recorded in Eurodac in breach of this Regulation, it shall inform eu-LISA, the Commission and the Member State of origin thereof as soon as possible. The Member State of origin shall check the data concerned and, if necessary, amend or erase them without delay.
