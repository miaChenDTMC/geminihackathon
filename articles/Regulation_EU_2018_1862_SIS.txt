REGULATION (EU) 2018/1862 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 28 November 2018

on the establishment, operation and use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, amending and repealing Council Decision 2007/533/JHA, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1986/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Decision 2010/261/EU

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular point (d) of the second subparagraph of Article 82(1), Article 85(1), Article 87(2)(a) and Article 88(2)(a) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure

(

1

)

,

Whereas:

(1)

The Schengen Information System (SIS) constitutes an essential tool for the application of the provisions of the Schengen

acquis

as integrated into the framework of the European Union. SIS is one of the major compensatory measures contributing to maintaining a high level of security within the area of freedom, security and justice of the Union by supporting operational cooperation between national competent authorities, in particular border guards, the police, customs authorities, immigration authorities, and authorities responsible for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences or execution of criminal penalties.

(2)

SIS was initially set up pursuant to the provisions of Title IV of the Convention of 19 June 1990 implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders

(

2

)

(the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement). The development of the second generation of SIS (SIS II) was entrusted to the Commission pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 2424/2001

(

3

)

and Council Decision 2001/886/JHA

(

4

)

. It was later established by Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

5

)

and by Council Decision 2007/533/JHA

(

6

)

. SIS II replaced SIS as created pursuant to the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement.

(3)

Three years after SIS II was brought into operation, the Commission carried out an evaluation of the system in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 and Decision 2007/533/JHA. On 21 December 2016, the Commission submitted the Report on the Evaluation of the Second Generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) in accordance with Articles 24(5), 43(3) and 50(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 and Articles 59(3) and 66(5) of Decision 2007/533/JHA and an accompanying staff working document to the European Parliament and to the Council. The recommendations set out in those documents should be reflected, as appropriate, in this Regulation.

(4)

This Regulation constitutes the legal basis for SIS in respect of matters falling within the scope of Chapters 4 and 5 of Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Regulation (EU) 2018/1861 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

7

)

constitutes the legal basis for SIS in respect of matters falling within the scope of Chapter 2 of Title V of Part Three TFEU.

(5)

The fact that the legal basis for SIS consists of separate instruments does not affect the principle that SIS constitutes one single information system that should operate as such. It should include a single network of national offices called SIRENE Bureaux for ensuring the exchange of supplementary information. Certain provisions of those instruments should therefore be identical.

(6)

It is necessary to specify the objectives of SIS, certain elements of its technical architecture and its financing, to lay down rules concerning its end-to-end operation and use and to define responsibilities. It is also necessary to determine the categories of data to be entered into the system, the purposes for which the data are to be entered and processed and the criteria for their entry. Rules are also required to govern the deletion of alerts, the authorities authorised to access the data, the use of biometric data and to further determine data protection and data processing rules.

(7)

Alerts in SIS contain only the information necessary to identify a person or an object and for the action to be taken. Member States should therefore exchange supplementary information related to alerts where required.

(8)

SIS includes a central system (Central SIS) and national systems. The national systems might contain a complete or partial copy of the SIS database, which may be shared by two or more Member States. Considering that SIS is the most important information exchange instrument in Europe for ensuring security and effective border management, it is necessary to ensure its uninterrupted operation at central as well as at national level. The availability of SIS should be subject to close monitoring at central and Member State level and any incident of unavailability for end-users should be registered and reported to stakeholders at national and Union level. Each Member State should set up a backup for its national system. Member States should also ensure uninterrupted connectivity with Central SIS by having duplicated and physically and geographically separated connection points. Central SIS and the Communication Infrastructure should be operated in such a way that their functioning 24 hours a day, 7 days a week is ensured. For that reason the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (‘eu-LISA’), established by Regulation (EU) 2018/1726 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

8

)

should implement technical solutions to reinforce the uninterrupted availability of SIS, subject to an independent impact assessment and cost-benefit analysis.

(9)

It is necessary to maintain a manual setting out the detailed rules for the exchange of supplementary information concerning the actions called for by alerts (‘the SIRENE Manual’). The SIRENE Bureaux, should ensure the exchange of such information in a fast and efficient manner.

(10)

In order to ensure the efficient exchange of supplementary information, including on the action to be taken specified in alerts, it is appropriate to reinforce the functioning of the SIRENE Bureaux by specifying the requirements concerning the available resources and user training and the response time to inquiries they receive from other SIRENE Bureaux.

(11)

Member States should ensure that the staff of their SIRENE Bureau have the linguistic skills and knowledge of relevant law and procedural rules necessary to perform their tasks.

(12)

In order to be able to fully benefit from the functionalities of SIS, Member States should ensure that end-users and the staff of the SIRENE Bureaux regularly receive training, including on data security, data protection and data quality. SIRENE Bureaux should be involved in the development of training programmes. To the extent possible, SIRENE Bureaux should also provide for staff exchanges with other SIRENE Bureaux at least once a year. Member States are encouraged to take appropriate measures to avoid the loss of skills and experience through staff turnover.

(13)

The operational management of the central components of SIS are exercised by eu-LISA. In order to enable eu-LISA to dedicate the necessary financial and personal resources covering all aspects of the operational management of Central SIS and the Communication Infrastructure, this Regulation should set out its tasks in detail, in particular with regard to the technical aspects of the exchange of supplementary information.

(14)

Without prejudice to the responsibility of Member States for the accuracy of data entered into SIS and to the role of the SIRENE Bureaux as quality coordinators, eu-LISA should be responsible for reinforcing data quality by introducing a central data quality monitoring tool, and should provide reports at regular intervals to the Commission and to the Member States. The Commission should report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the data quality issues encountered. To further increase the quality of data in SIS, eu-LISA should also offer training on the use of SIS to national training bodies and, insofar as possible, to the SIRENE Bureaux and to end-users.

(15)

In order to allow better monitoring of the use of SIS and to analyse trends concerning criminal offences, eu-LISA should be able to develop a state-of-the-art capability for statistical reporting to the Member States, to the European Parliament, to the Council, to the Commission, to Europol, to Eurojust and to the European Border and Coast Guard Agency without jeopardising data integrity. Therefore, a central repository should be established. Statistics retained in or obtained from that repository should not contain any personal data. Member States should communicate statistics concerning exercise of the right of access, rectification of inaccurate data and erasure of unlawfully stored data in the framework of cooperation between supervisory authorities and the European Data Protection Supervisor under this Regulation.

(16)

New data categories should be introduced in SIS to allow end-users to take informed decisions based upon an alert without losing time. Therefore, in order to facilitate identification and detect multiple identities, the alert should, where such information is available, include a reference to the personal identification document of the individual concerned or its number and a copy, if possible in colour, of the document.

(17)

Competent authorities should be able, where strictly necessary, to enter into SIS specific information relating to any specific, objective, physical characteristics of a person which are not subject to change, such as tattoos, marks or scars.

(18)

Where available, all the relevant data, in particular the forename of the individual concerned, should be inserted when creating an alert, in order to minimise the risk of false hits and unnecessary operational activities.

(19)

SIS should not store any data used to carry out searches with the exception of keeping logs to verify whether the search is lawful, for monitoring the lawfulness of data processing, for self-monitoring and for ensuring the proper functioning of the national systems as well as for data integrity and security.

(20)

SIS should permit the processing of biometric data in order to assist in the reliable identification of the individuals concerned. Any entry of photographs, facial images or dactyloscopic data into SIS and any use of such data should be limited to what is necessary for the objectives pursued, should be authorised by Union law, should respect fundamental rights, including the best interests of the child, and should be in accordance with Union law on data protection, including the relevant provisions on data protection laid down in this Regulation. In the same perspective, in order to avoid inconveniences caused by misidentification, SIS should also allow for the processing of data concerning individuals whose identity has been misused, subject to suitable safeguards, to obtaining the consent of the individual concerned for each data category, in particular palm prints, and to a strict limitation of the purposes for which such personal data can be lawfully processed.

(21)

Member States should make the necessary technical arrangements so that each time end-users are entitled to carry out a search in a national police or immigration database, they also search SIS in parallel, subject to the principles set out in Article 4 of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

9

)

and Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

10

)

. This should ensure that SIS functions as the main compensatory measure in the area without internal border controls and better addresses the cross-border dimension of criminality and the mobility of criminals.

(22)

This Regulation should set out the conditions for use of dactyloscopic data, photographs and facial images for identification and verification purposes. Facial images and photographs should, for identification purposes, initially be used only in the context of regular border crossing points. Such use should be subject to a report by the Commission confirming the availability, reliability and readiness of the technology.

(23)

The introduction of an automated fingerprint identification service within SIS complements the existing Prüm mechanism on mutual cross-border online access to designated national DNA databases and automated fingerprint identification systems, as set out in Council Decisions 2008/615/JHA

(

11

)

and 2008/616/JHA

(

12

)

. The SIS dactyloscopic data search allows an active search for the perpetrator. Therefore, it should be possible to upload the dactyloscopic data of an unknown perpetrator into SIS, provided that the owner of that data can be identified with a very high degree of probability as the perpetrator of a serious crime or act of terrorism. This is in particular the case if dactyloscopic data are found on the weapon or on any object used for the offence. The mere presence of the dactyloscopic data at the crime scene should not be considered as indicating a very high degree of probability that the dactyloscopic data are those of the perpetrator. A further precondition for the creation of such an alert should be that the identity of the suspect cannot be established on the basis of data from any other relevant national, Union or international database. Should a dactyloscopic data search lead to a potential match, the Member State should carry out further checks with the involvement of experts to establish whether the suspect is the owner of the prints stored in SIS, and should establish the identity of the person. The procedure should be subject to national law. Such identification could substantially contribute to the investigation and could lead to an arrest provided that all the conditions for an arrest are met.

(24)

It should be allowed to search dactyloscopic data stored in SIS with complete or incomplete sets of fingerprints or palm prints found at a crime scene if it can be established to a high degree of probability that they belong to the perpetrator of the serious crime or terrorist offence, provided that a search is carried out simultaneously in the relevant national fingerprint databases. Particular attention should be given to the establishment of quality standards applicable to the storage of biometric data, including latent dactyloscopic data.

(25)

Wherever the identity of a person cannot be ascertained by any other means, dactyloscopic data should be used to attempt identification. It should be allowed in all cases to identify a person by using dactyloscopic data.

(26)

It should be possible to add a DNA profile to an alert in clearly defined cases where dactyloscopic data are not available. That DNA profile should only be accessible to authorised users. DNA profiles should facilitate the identification of missing persons in need of protection and particularly missing children, including by allowing the use of DNA profiles of direct ascendants, descendants or siblings to enable identification. DNA data should contain only the minimum information necessary for identification of the missing person.

(27)

DNA profiles should only be retrieved from SIS where identification is necessary and proportionate for the purposes laid down in this Regulation. DNA profiles should not be retrieved or processed for any other purpose than those for which they were entered into SIS. The data protection and security rules laid down in this Regulation should apply. Additional safeguards, if necessary, should be put in place when using DNA profiles in order to avoid any risk of false matches, hacking and unauthorised sharing with third parties.

(28)

SIS should contain alerts on persons wanted for arrest for surrender purposes and wanted for arrest for extradition purposes. In addition to alerts, it is appropriate to provide for the exchange of supplementary information through the SIRENE Bureaux which is necessary for the surrender and extradition procedures. In particular, data referred to in Article 8 of Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA

(

13

)

should be processed in SIS. Due to operational reasons, it is appropriate for the issuing Member State to make an existing alert for arrest temporarily unavailable upon the authorisation of the judicial authorities when a person who is the subject of a European Arrest Warrant is intensively and actively searched and end-users not involved in the concrete search operation may jeopardise the successful outcome. The temporary unavailability of such alerts should in principle not exceed 48 hours.

(29)

It should be possible to add to SIS a translation of the additional data entered for the purpose of surrender under the European Arrest Warrant and for the purpose of extradition.

(30)

SIS should contain alerts on missing persons or on vulnerable persons who need to be prevented from travelling to ensure their protection or to prevent threats to public security or to public order. In the case of children, these alerts and the corresponding procedures should serve the best interests of the child in accordance with Article 24 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989. Actions and decisions by the competent authorities, including judicial authorities, following an alert on a child should be taken in cooperation with child protection authorities. The national hotline for missing children should be informed, where appropriate.

(31)

Alerts on missing persons who need to be placed under protection should be entered at the request of the competent authority. All children who have gone missing from Member States' reception facilities should be the subject of an alert on missing persons in SIS.

(32)

Alerts on children at risk of parental child abduction should be entered into SIS at the request of competent authorities, including judicial authorities having jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility under national law. Alerts on children at risk of parental child abduction should only be entered in SIS where this risk is concrete and apparent and in limited circumstances. Therefore it is necessary to provide for strict and appropriate safeguards. In assessing whether a concrete and apparent risk exists that a child may be imminently and unlawfully removed from a Member State, the competent authority should take into account the child's personal circumstances and the environment to which the child is exposed.

(33)

This Regulation should establish a new category of alerts for certain categories of vulnerable persons who need to be prevented from travelling. Persons who, due to their age, disabilities, or their family circumstances require protection should be considered vulnerable.

(34)

Alerts on children who need to be prevented from travelling for their own protection should be entered into SIS if there is a concrete and apparent risk of them being removed from or leaving the territory of a Member State. Such alerts should be entered if the travel would put them at risk of becoming victims of trafficking in human beings or of forced marriage, female genital mutilation or other forms of gender-based violence, of becoming victims or being involved in terrorist offences, of being conscripted or enlisted into armed groups, or of being made to participate actively in hostilities.

(35)

Alerts on vulnerable adults who need to be prevented from travelling for their own protection should be entered if travel would put them at risk of becoming victims of trafficking in human beings or gender-based violence.

(36)

In order to guarantee strict and appropriate safeguards, alerts on children or other vulnerable persons who need to be prevented from travelling should, where required under national law, be entered into SIS following a decision by a judicial authority or a decision by a competent authority confirmed by a judicial authority.

(37)

A new action to be taken should be introduced to allow a person to be stopped and interviewed in order for the issuing Member State to obtain detailed information. This action should apply in cases where, based on a clear indication, a person is suspected of intending to commit or of committing any of the offences referred to in Article 2(1) and (2) of Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA, where further information is needed to execute a custodial sentence or detention order against a person convicted of any of the offences referred to in Article 2(1) and (2) of Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA, or where there is a reason to believe that he or she will commit any of those offences. This action to be taken should also be without prejudice to existing mutual legal assistance mechanisms. It should supply sufficient information to decide upon further actions. This new action should not amount to searching the person nor to his or her arrest. The procedural rights of suspects and accused persons under Union and national law should be preserved, including their right to have access to a lawyer in accordance with Directive 2013/48/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

14

)

.

(38)

In the case of alerts on objects for seizure or use as evidence in criminal proceedings, the objects concerned should be seized in accordance with national law that determines if and in accordance with which conditions an object is to be seized, particularly if it is in the possession of its rightful owner.

(39)

SIS should contain new categories of objects of high value, such as items of information technology which can be identified and searched with a unique identification number.

(40)

As regards alerts entered into SIS on documents for seizure or use as evidence in criminal proceedings, the term ‘false’ should be construed as encompassing both forged and counterfeit documents.

(41)

It should be possible for a Member State to add an indication, called a flag, to an alert, to the effect that the action to be taken on the basis of the alert will not be taken on its territory. When alerts are entered for arrest for surrender purposes, nothing in this Regulation should be construed so as to derogate from or prevent the application of the provisions contained in the Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA. The decision to add a flag to an alert with a view to the non-execution of a European Arrest Warrant should be based only on the grounds for refusal contained in that Framework Decision.

(42)

When a flag has been added and the whereabouts of the person wanted for arrest for surrender become known, the person's whereabouts should always be communicated to the issuing judicial authority, which may decide to transmit a European Arrest Warrant to the competent judicial authority in accordance with the provisions of the Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA.

(43)

It should be possible for Member States to establish links between alerts in SIS. The establishment of links between two or more alerts should have no impact on the action to be taken, the review period for alerts or the access rights to the alerts.

(44)

Alerts should not be kept in SIS longer than the time required to fulfil the specific purposes for which they were entered. The review periods for different categories of alerts should be appropriate in light of their purpose. Alerts on objects which are linked to an alert on a person should only be kept for as long as the alert on the person is kept. Decisions to retain alerts on persons should be based on a comprehensive individual assessment. Member States should review alerts on persons and objects within the prescribed review periods and should keep statistics on the number of alerts for which the retention period has been extended.

(45)

Entering an alert into SIS and extending the expiry date of an alert in SIS should be subject to a proportionality requirement involving examination of whether a concrete case is adequate, relevant and important enough to warrant insertion of an alert in SIS. Where terrorist offences are concerned, the case should be considered adequate, relevant and important enough to warrant an alert in SIS. For public or national security reasons, Member States should be allowed exceptionally to refrain from entering an alert into SIS when it is likely that this would obstruct official or legal inquiries, investigations or procedures.

(46)

It is necessary to establish rules concerning the deletion of alerts. An alert should be kept only for the time required to achieve the purpose for which it was entered. Considering the diverging practices of Member States in determining the point in time when an alert has fulfilled its purpose, it is appropriate to set out detailed criteria for each category of alert to determine when it should be deleted.

(47)

The integrity of SIS data is of primary importance. Therefore, appropriate safeguards should be provided to process SIS data at central as well as at national level to ensure the end-to-end security of the data. The authorities involved in the data processing should be bound by the security requirements of this Regulation and be subject to a uniform incident reporting procedure. Their staff should be appropriately trained and be informed of any offences and penalties in this respect.

(48)

Data processed in SIS and the related supplementary information exchanged pursuant to this Regulation should not be transferred or made available to third countries or to international organisations.

(49)

It is appropriate to grant access to SIS to services responsible for registering vehicles, boats and aircraft in order to allow them to verify whether the conveyance concerned is being searched for in Member States for seizure. It is also appropriate to grant access to SIS to services responsible for registering firearms in order to allow them to verify whether the firearm concerned is being searched for in Member States for seizure or whether there is an alert on the person requesting the registration.

(50)

Direct access to SIS should only be provided to competent government services. This access should be limited to alerts concerning the respective conveyances and their registration document or number plate or firearms and persons requesting the registration. Any hit in SIS should be reported by such services to the police authorities, who should take further action in line with the particular alert in SIS and notify the issuing Member State of the hit through the SIRENE Bureaux.

(51)

Without prejudice to more specific rules laid down in this Regulation, the national laws, regulations and administrative provisions adopted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2016/680 should apply to the processing, including collection and communication of personal data under this Regulation by the national competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties. Access to data entered into SIS and the right to search such data by national competent authorities which are responsible for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties are to be subject to all relevant provisions of this Regulation and those of Directive (EU) 2016/680 as transposed into national law, and in particular to monitoring by the supervisory authorities referred to in Directive (EU) 2016/680.

(52)

Without prejudice to more specific rules laid down in this Regulation for the processing of personal data, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 should apply to the processing of personal data by the Member States under this Regulation unless such processing is carried out by the national competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences.

(53)

Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

15

)

should apply to the processing of personal data by the institutions and bodies of the Union when carrying out their responsibilities under this Regulation.

(54)

Regulation (EU) 2016/794 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

16

)

should apply to the processing of personal data by Europol under this Regulation.

(55)

In cases when searches carried out in SIS by national members of Eurojust and their assistants reveal the existence of an alert entered by a Member State, Eurojust cannot take the requested action. Therefore, it should inform the Member State concerned to allow it to follow up the case.

(56)

When using SIS, the competent authorities should ensure that the dignity and integrity of the person whose data are processed are respected. Processing of personal data for the purposes of this Regulation is not to result in discrimination against persons on any grounds, such as sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.

(57)

Insofar as confidentiality is concerned, the relevant provisions of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Union and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the Union, laid down in Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68

(

17

)

(‘Staff Regulations’) should apply to officials or other servants employed and working in connection with SIS.

(58)

Both the Member States and eu-LISA should maintain security plans in order to facilitate the implementation of security obligations and should cooperate with each other in order to address security issues from a common perspective.

(59)

The national independent supervisory authorities referred to in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive (EU) 2016/680 (‘supervisory authorities’) should monitor the lawfulness of the processing of personal data by the Member States under this Regulation, including the exchange of supplementary information. The supervisory authorities should be granted sufficient resources to carry out this task. The rights of data subjects to access, rectify and erase their personal data that is stored in SIS, and any subsequent remedies before national courts as well as the mutual recognition of judgments should be provided for. It is also appropriate to require annual statistics from Member States.

(60)

The supervisory authorities should ensure that an audit of the data processing operations in their Member State's national systems is carried out in accordance with international auditing standards at least every four years. The audit should either be carried out by the supervisory authorities, or the supervisory authorities should directly order the audit from an independent data protection auditor. The independent auditor should remain under the control and responsibility of the supervisory authorities concerned which therefore should instruct the auditor themselves and provide a clearly defined purpose, scope and methodology for the audit as well as guidance and supervision concerning the audit and its final results.

(61)

The European Data Protection Supervisor should monitor the activities of the Union institutions and bodies in relation to the processing of personal data under this Regulation. The European Data Protection Supervisor and the supervisory authorities should cooperate with each other in monitoring SIS.

(62)

The European Data Protection Supervisor should be granted sufficient resources to fulfil the tasks entrusted to it under this Regulation, including assistance from persons with expertise in biometric data.

(63)

Regulation (EU) 2016/794 provides that Europol is to support and strengthens actions carried out by the national competent authorities and their cooperation in combating terrorism and serious crime and to provide analysis and threat assessments. The extension of Europol's access rights to alerts on missing persons should further improve Europol's capacity to provide national law enforcement authorities with comprehensive operational and analytical products concerning trafficking in human beings and child sexual exploitation, including online. This would contribute to better prevention of those criminal offences, to the protection of potential victims and to the investigation of perpetrators. Europol's European Cybercrime Centre would also benefit from Europol having access to alerts on missing persons, including in cases of travelling sex offenders and child sexual abuse online, where perpetrators often claim that they have access to children or can get access to children who might have been registered as missing.

(64)

In order to bridge the gap in information sharing on terrorism, in particular on foreign terrorist fighters — where monitoring of their movement is crucial — Member States are encouraged to share information on terrorism-related activity with Europol. This information sharing should be carried out through the exchange of supplementary information with Europol on the alerts concerned. For this purpose Europol should set up a connection with the Communication Infrastructure.

(65)

It is also necessary to set out clear rules for Europol on the processing and downloading of SIS data to allow it to use SIS comprehensively, provided that data protection standards are complied with as provided for in this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2016/794. In cases where searches carried out by Europol in SIS reveal the existence of an alert entered by a Member State, Europol cannot take the required action. Therefore it should inform the Member State concerned through the exchange of supplementary information with the respective SIRENE Bureau, to allow that Member State to follow up the case.

(66)

Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

18

)

provides for the purpose of that Regulation, that the host Member State is to authorise the members of the teams referred to in point (8) of Article 2 of that Regulation, deployed by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency to consult Union databases where this consultation is necessary for fulfilling operational aims specified in the operational plan on border checks, border surveillance and return. Other relevant Union agencies, in particular the European Asylum Support Office and Europol, may also deploy experts who are not members of the staff of those Union agencies as part of migration management support teams. The objective of the deployment of the teams referred to in points (8) and (9) of Article 2 of that Regulation is to provide technical and operational reinforcement to the requesting Member States, especially to those facing disproportionate migratory challenges. For the teams referred to in points (8) and (9) of Article 2 of that Regulation to fulfil their tasks, they require access to SIS through a technical interface of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency connecting to Central SIS. In cases where searches in SIS carried out by the teams referred to in points (8) and (9) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 or by the teams of staff reveal the existence of an alert entered by a Member State, the member of the team or the staff cannot take the required action unless authorised to do so by the host Member State. Therefore, the host Member State should be informed to allow it to follow up the case. The host Member State should notify the issuing Member State of the hit through the exchange of supplementary information.

(67)

Certain aspects of SIS cannot be covered exhaustively by this Regulation given their technical, highly detailed and frequently changing nature. Those aspects include, for example, technical rules on entering data, on updating, deleting and searching data and on data quality and rules related to biometric data rules on the compatibility and order of priority of alerts, on links between alerts, setting the expiry date of alerts within the maximum time limit and on the exchange of supplementary information. Implementing powers in respect of those aspects should therefore be conferred on the Commission. Technical rules on searching alerts should take into account the smooth operation of national applications.

(68)

In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

19

)

. The procedure for adopting implementing acts under this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2018/1861 should be the same.

(69)

In order to ensure transparency, two years after the start of operations of SIS pursuant to this Regulation, eu-LISA should produce a report on the technical functioning of Central SIS and the Communication Infrastructure, including their security, and on the bilateral and multilateral exchange of supplementary information. An overall evaluation should be issued by the Commission every four years.

(70)

In order to ensure the smooth functioning of SIS, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of new sub-categories of objects to be sought under alerts on objects for seizure or used as evidence in criminal proceedings, and the determination of the circumstances in which photographs and facial images may be used for the identification of persons other than in the context of regular border crossing points. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making

(

)

. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.

(71)

Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely the establishment and regulation of a Union information system and the exchange of related supplementary information, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of their nature be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

(72)

This Regulation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, this Regulation fully respects the protection of personal data in accordance with Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union while seeking to ensure a safe environment for all persons residing on the territory of the Union and special protection for children who could be victim of trafficking or abduction. In cases concerning children, the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration.

(73)

Technical architecture and ways of operating SIS

1.   SIS shall be composed of:

(a)

a central system (Central SIS) composed of:

(i)

a technical support function (‘CS-SIS’) containing a database (the ‘SIS database’), and including a backup CS-SIS;

(ii)

a uniform national interface (‘NI-SIS’);

(b)

a national system (N.SIS) in each of the Member States, consisting of the national data systems which communicate with Central SIS, including at least one national or shared backup N.SIS; and

(c)

a communication infrastructure between CS-SIS, backup CS-SIS and NI-SIS (‘the Communication Infrastructure’) that provides an encrypted virtual network dedicated to SIS data and the exchange of data between SIRENE Bureaux, as referred to in Article 7(2).

An N.SIS as referred to in point (b) may contain a data file (a ‘national copy’) containing a complete or partial copy of the SIS database. Two or more Member States may establish in one of their N.SIS a shared copy which may be used jointly by those Member States. Such shared copy shall be considered as the national copy of each of those Member States.

A shared backup N.SIS as referred to in point (b) may be used jointly by two or more Member States. In such cases, the shared backup N.SIS shall be considered as the backup N.SIS of each of those Member States. The N.SIS and its backup may be used simultaneously to ensure uninterrupted availability to end-users.

Member States intending to establish a shared copy or shared backup N.SIS to be used jointly shall agree their respective responsibilities in writing. They shall notify their arrangement to the Commission.

The Communication Infrastructure shall support and contribute to ensuring the uninterrupted availability of SIS. It shall include redundant and separated paths for the connections between CS-SIS and the backup CS-SIS and shall also include redundant and separated paths for the connections between each SIS national network access point and CS-SIS and backup CS-SIS.

2.   Member States shall enter, update, delete and search SIS data through their own N.SIS. The Member States using a partial or a complete national copy or a partial or complete shared copy shall make that copy available for the purpose of carrying out automated searches in the territory of each of those Member States. The partial national or shared copy shall contain at least the data listed in points (a) to (v) of Article 20 (3). It shall not be possible to search the data files of other Member States' N.SIS except in the case of shared copies.

3.   CS-SIS shall perform technical supervision and administration functions and have a backup CS-SIS, capable of ensuring all functionalities of the principal CS-SIS in the event of failure of that system. CS-SIS and the backup CS-SIS shall be located in the two technical sites of eu-LISA.

4.   eu-LISA shall implement technical solutions to reinforce the uninterrupted availability of SIS either through the simultaneous operation of CS-SIS and the backup CS-SIS, provided that the backup CS-SIS remains capable of ensuring the operation of SIS in the event of a failure of CS-SIS, or through duplication of the system or its components. Notwithstanding the procedural requirements laid down in Article 10 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1726 eu-LISA shall no later than 28 December 2019, prepare a study on the options for technical solutions, containing an independent impact assessment and cost-benefit analysis.

5.   Where necessary in exceptional circumstances, eu-LISA may temporarily develop an additional copy of the SIS database.

6.   CS-SIS shall provide the services necessary for the entry and processing of SIS data, including searches in the SIS database. For the Member States which use a national or shared copy, CS-SIS shall:

(a)

provide online updates for the national copies;

(b)

ensure synchronisation of and consistency between the national copies and the SIS database; and

(c)

provide the operation for initialisation and restoration of the national copies.

7.   CS-SIS shall provide uninterrupted availability.

Article 5

Costs

1.   The costs of operating, maintaining and further developing Central SIS and the Communication Infrastructure shall be borne by the general budget of the Union. Those costs shall include work done with respect to CS-SIS, in order to ensure the provision of the services referred to in Article 4(6).

Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 76(2).

5.   Technical rules shall be similar for searches in CS-SIS, in national or shared copies and in technical copies made under Article 56(2). They shall be based on common standards.

Article 21

Proportionality

1.   Before entering an alert and when extending the period of validity of an alert, Member States shall determine whether the case is adequate, relevant and important enough to warrant an alert in SIS.

2.   Where a person or an object is sought under an alert related to a terrorist offence, the case shall be considered adequate, relevant and important enough to warrant an alert in SIS. For public or national security reasons, Member States may exceptionally refrain from entering an alert when it is likely to obstruct official or legal inquiries, investigations or procedures.

Article 22

Requirement for an alert to be entered

1.   The minimum set of data necessary in order to enter an alert into SIS shall be the data referred to in points (a), (g), (k) and (n) of Article 20(3), except for in the situations referred to in Article 40. The other data referred to in that paragraph shall also be entered into SIS, if available.

Article 23

Compatibility of alerts

1.   Before entering an alert, the Member State shall check whether the person or the object concerned is already the subject of an alert in SIS. To check whether the person is already the subject of an alert, a check with dactyloscopic data shall also be carried out if such data are available.

2.   Only one alert per person or per object per Member State shall be entered into SIS. Where necessary, new alerts may be entered on the same person or object by other Member States, in accordance with paragraph 3.

3.   Where a person or an object is already the subject of an alert in SIS, a Member State wishing to enter a new alert shall check that there is no incompatibility between the alerts. If there is no incompatibility, the Member State may enter the new alert. If the alerts are incompatible, the SIRENE Bureaux of the Member States concerned shall consult each other by exchanging supplementary information in order to reach an agreement. Rules on the compatibility of alerts shall be laid down in the SIRENE Manual. Departures from the compatibility rules may be made after consultation between the Member States if essential national interests are at stake.

4.   In the case of hits on multiple alerts on the same person or object, the executing Member State shall observe the priority rules for alerts laid down in the SIRENE Manual.

If a person is subject to multiple alerts entered by different Member States, alerts for arrest entered in accordance with Article 26 shall be executed as a priority, subject to Article 25.

Article 24

General provisions on flagging

1.   Where a Member State considers that to give effect to an alert entered in accordance with Article 26, 32 or 36 is incompatible with its national law, its international obligations or essential national interests, it may require that a flag be added to the alert to the effect that the action to be taken on the basis of the alert will not be taken in its territory. The flag shall be added by the SIRENE Bureau of the issuing Member State.

2.   In order to enable Member States to require that a flag be added to an alert entered in accordance with Article 26, all Member States shall be notified automatically of any new alert of that category through the exchange of supplementary information.

3.   If in particularly urgent and serious cases, an issuing Member State requests the execution of the action, the executing Member State shall examine whether it is able to allow the flag added at its behest to be withdrawn. If the executing Member State is able to do so, it shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the action to be taken can be carried out immediately.

Article 25

Flagging related to alerts for arrest for surrender purposes

1.   Where Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA applies, a Member State shall request the issuing Member State to add a flag preventing arrest as a follow-up to an alert for arrest for surrender purposes where the competent judicial authority under national law for the execution of a European Arrest Warrant has refused its execution on the basis of a ground for non-execution and where the addition of the flag has been required.

A Member State may also require that a flag be added to the alert if its competent judicial authority releases the subject of the alert during the surrender process.

2.   However, at the behest of a competent judicial authority under national law, either on the basis of a general instruction or in a specific case, a Member State may also require the issuing Member State to add a flag to an alert for arrest for surrender purposes if it is obvious that the execution of the European Arrest Warrant will have to be refused.

CHAPTER VI

2.   Alerts for arrest for surrender purposes shall also be entered on the basis of arrest warrants issued, in accordance with agreements concluded between the Union and third countries on the basis of the Treaties, for the purpose of surrender of persons on the basis of an arrest warrant, which provide for the transmission of such an arrest warrant through SIS.

3.   Any reference in this Regulation to provisions of Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA shall be construed as including the corresponding provisions of agreements concluded between the Union and third countries on the basis of the Treaties, for the purpose of surrender of persons on the basis of an arrest warrant which provide for the transmission of such an arrest warrant through SIS.

4.   In the case of an ongoing operation, the issuing Member State may temporarily make an existing alert for arrest entered in accordance with this Article unavailable for searching by the end-users in the Member States involved in the operation. In such cases the alert shall only be accessible to the SIRENE Bureaux. Member States shall only make an alert unavailable if:

(a)

the purpose of the operation cannot be achieved by other measures;

(b)

a prior authorisation has been granted by the competent judicial authority of the issuing Member State; and

(c)

all Member States involved in the operation have been informed through the exchange of supplementary information.

The functionality provided for in the first subparagraph shall only be used for a period not exceeding 48 hours. However, if operationally necessary, it may be extended by further periods of 48 hours. Member States shall keep statistics on the number of alerts in relation to which this functionality has been used.

5.   Where there is a clear indication that the objects referred to in points (a), (b), (c), (e), (g), (h), (j) and (k) of Article 38(2) are connected with a person who is the subject of an alert pursuant to paragraph 1 and 2 of this Article, alerts on those objects may be entered in order to locate the person. In such cases, the alert on the person and the alert on the object shall be linked in accordance with Article 63.

6.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts to lay down and develop rules necessary for entering, updating, deleting and searching the data referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 76(2).

Article 27

Additional data on persons wanted for arrest for surrender purposes

1.   Where a person is wanted for arrest for surrender purposes on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant, the issuing Member State shall enter into SIS a copy of the original of the European Arrest Warrant.

A Member State may enter the copy of more than one European Arrest Warrant in an alert for arrest for surrender purposes.

2.   The issuing Member State may enter a copy of a translation of the European Arrest Warrant in one or more other official languages of the institutions of the Union.

Article 28

Supplementary information on persons wanted for arrest for surrender purposes

The issuing Member State of an alert for arrest for surrender purposes shall communicate the information referred to in Article 8(1) of Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA to the other Member States through the exchange of supplementary information.

Article 29

Supplementary information on persons wanted for arrest for extradition purposes

1.   The issuing Member State of an alert for extradition purposes shall communicate the following data to all other Member States through the exchange of supplementary information:

(a)

the authority which issued the request for arrest;

(b)

whether there is an arrest warrant or a document having the same legal effect, or an enforceable judgment;

(c)

the nature and legal classification of the offence;

(d)

a description of the circumstances in which the offence was committed, including the time, place and the degree of participation in the offence by the person on whom the alert has been entered;

(e)

insofar as possible, the consequences of the offence; and

(f)

any other information useful or necessary for the execution of the alert.

2.   The data listed in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not be communicated where the data referred to in Article 27 or 28 have already been provided and are considered sufficient for the execution of the alert by the executing Member State.

Article 30

Conversion of an action to be taken concerning alerts for arrest for surrender or extradition purposes

Where an arrest cannot be made, either because the Member State requested to do so refuses to make it in accordance with the procedures on flagging set out in Article 24 or 25, or because, in the case of an alert for arrest for extradition purposes, an investigation has not been completed, the Member State requested to make the arrest shall act on the alert by communicating the whereabouts of the person concerned.

Article 31

Execution of an action based on an alert for arrest for surrender or extradition purposes

1.   An alert entered in SIS in accordance with Article 26 and the additional data referred to in Article 27 shall together constitute and have the same effect as a European Arrest Warrant issued in accordance with Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA where that Framework Decision applies.

2.   Where Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA does not apply, an alert entered in SIS in accordance with Articles 26 and 29 shall have the same legal force as a request for provisional arrest under Article 16 of the European Convention on Extradition of 13 December 1957 or Article 15 of the Benelux Treaty concerning Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 27 June 1962.

CHAPTER VII

CHAPTER XI

Alerts on unknown wanted persons for the purposes of identification under national law

Article 40

Alerts on unknown wanted persons for the purposes of identification under national law

Member States may enter into SIS alerts on unknown wanted persons containing only dactyloscopic data. Those dactyloscopic data shall be either complete or incomplete sets of fingerprints or palm prints discovered at the scenes of terrorist offences or other serious crimes under investigation. They shall only be entered into SIS where it can be established to a very high degree of probability that they belong to a perpetrator of the offence.

If the competent authority of the issuing Member State cannot establish the identity of the suspect on the basis of data from any other relevant national, Union or international database, the dactyloscopic data referred to in the first subparagraph may only be entered in this category of alerts as ‘unknown wanted person’ for the purpose of identifying such a person.

Article 41

Execution of the action based on an alert

In the event of a hit with the data entered pursuant to Article 40, the identity of the person shall be established in accordance with national law, together with expert verification that the dactyloscopic data in SIS belong to the person. The executing Member States shall communicate information on the identity and the whereabouts of the person to the issuing Member State through the exchange of supplementary information in order to facilitate timely investigation of the case.

CHAPTER XII

Specific rules for biometric data

Article 42

Specific rules for entering photographs, facial images, dactyloscopic data and DNA profiles

1.   Only photographs, facial images, dactyloscopic data referred to in points (w) and (y) of Article 20(3) which fulfil minimum data quality standards and technical specifications shall be entered into SIS. Before such data are entered, a quality check shall be performed in order to ascertain whether the minimum data quality standards and technical specifications have been met.

2.   Dactyloscopic data entered in SIS may consist of one to ten flat fingerprints and one to ten rolled fingerprints. It may also include up to two palm prints.

3.   A DNA profile may only be added to alerts in the situations provided for in point (a) of Article 32(1), only following a quality check to ascertain whether the minimum data quality standards and technical specifications have been met and only where photographs, facial images or dactyloscopic data are not available or not suitable for identification. The DNA profiles of persons who are direct ascendants, descendants or siblings of the subject of the alert may be added to the alert provided that those persons give their explicit consent. Where a DNA profile is added to an alert, that profile shall contain the minimum information strictly necessary for the identification of the missing person.

4.   Minimum data quality standards and technical specifications shall be established in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article for the storage of the biometric data referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 of this Article. Those minimum data quality standards and technical specifications shall set the level of quality required for using the data to verify the identity of a person in accordance with Article 43(1) and for using the data to identify a person in accordance with Article 43(2) to (4).

5.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts to lay down the minimum data quality standards and technical specifications referred to in paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 76(2).

Article 43

Specific rules for verification or search with photographs, facial images, dactyloscopic data and DNA profiles

1.   Where photographs, facial images, dactyloscopic data and DNA profiles are available in an alert in SIS, such photographs, facial images, dactyloscopic data and DNA profiles shall be used to confirm the identity of a person who has been located as a result of an alphanumeric search made in SIS.

2.   Dactyloscopic data may be searched in all cases to identify a person. However, dactyloscopic data shall be searched to identify a person where the identity of the person cannot be ascertained by other means. For that purpose, the Central SIS shall contain an Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS).

3.   Dactyloscopic data in SIS in relation to alerts entered in accordance with Articles 26, 32, 36 and 40 may also be searched using complete or incomplete sets of fingerprints or palm prints discovered at the scenes of serious crimes or terrorist offences under investigation, where it can be established to a high degree of probability that those sets of prints belong to a perpetrator of the offence and provided that the search is carried out simultaneously in the Member State's relevant national fingerprints databases.

4.   As soon as it becomes technically possible, and while ensuring a high degree of reliability of identification, photographs and facial images may be used to identify a person in the context of regular border crossing points.

Before this functionality is implemented in SIS, the Commission shall present a report on the availability, readiness and reliability of the required technology. The European Parliament shall be consulted on the report.

After the start of the use of the functionality at regular border crossing points, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 75 to supplement this Regulation concerning the determination of other circumstances in which photographs and facial images may be used to identify persons.

1.   Where upon a new alert being entered it becomes apparent that there is already an alert in SIS on a person with the same description of identity, the SIRENE Bureau shall contact the issuing Member State through the exchange of supplementary information within 12 hours to cross-check whether the subjects of the two alerts are the same person.

2.   Where the cross-check reveals that the subject of the new alert and the person subject to the alert already entered in SIS are indeed one and the same person, the SIRENE Bureau shall apply the procedure for entering multiple alerts referred to in Article 23.

3.   Where the outcome of the cross-check is that there are in fact two different persons, the SIRENE Bureau shall approve the request for entering the second alert by adding the data necessary to avoid any misidentifications.

Article 62

Additional data for the purpose of dealing with misused identities

1.   Where confusion may arise between the person intended to be the subject of an alert and a person whose identity has been misused, the issuing Member State shall, subject to the explicit consent of the person whose identity has been misused, add data relating to the latter to the alert in order to avoid the negative consequences of misidentification. Any person whose identity has been misused shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent regarding the processing of the added personal data.

2.   Where a search by Europol reveals the existence of an alert in SIS II, Europol shall inform the issuing Member State through the exchange of supplementary information by means of the Communication Infrastructure and in accordance with the provisions set out in the SIRENE Manual. Until Europol is able to use the functionalities intended for the exchange of supplementary information, it shall inform issuing Member States through the channels defined by Regulation (EU) 2016/794.

3.   Europol may process the supplementary information that has been provided to it by Member States for the purposes of comparing it with its databases and operational analysis projects, aimed at identifying connections or other relevant links and for the strategic, thematic or operational analyses referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 18(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/794. Any processing by Europol of supplementary information for the purpose of this Article shall be carried out in accordance with that Regulation.

4.   Europol's use of information obtained from a search in SIS II or from the processing of supplementary information shall be subject to the consent of the issuing Member State. If the Member State allows the use of such information, its handling by Europol shall be governed by Regulation (EU) 2016/794. Europol shall only communicate such information to third countries and third bodies with the consent of the issuing Member State and in full compliance with Union law on data protection.

5.   Europol shall:

(a)

without prejudice to paragraphs 4 and 6, not connect parts of SIS II nor transfer the data contained in it to which it has access to any system for data collection and processing operated by or at Europol, nor download or otherwise copy any part of SIS II;

(b)

notwithstanding Article 31(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/794, delete supplementary information containing personal data at the latest one year after the related alert has been deleted. By way of derogation, where Europol has information in its databases or operational analysis projects on a case to which the supplementary information is related, in order for Europol to perform its tasks, Europol may exceptionally continue to store the supplementary information when necessary. Europol shall inform the issuing and the executing Member State of the continued storage of such supplementary information and present a justification for it;

(c)

limit access to data in SIS II, including supplementary information, to specifically authorised staff of Europol who require access to such data for the performance of their tasks;

(d)

adopt and apply measures to ensure security, confidentiality and self-monitoring in accordance with Articles 10, 11 and 13;

(e)

ensure that its staff who are authorised to process SIS II data receive appropriate training and information in accordance with Article 14; and

(f)

without prejudice to Regulation (EU) 2016/794, allow the European Data Protection Supervisor to monitor and review the activities of Europol in the exercise of its right to access and search data in SIS II and in the exchange and processing of supplementary information.

6.   Europol shall only copy data from SIS II for technical purposes where such copying is necessary in order for duly authorised Europol staff to carry out a direct search. This Decision shall apply to such copies. The technical copy shall only be used for the purpose of storing SIS II data whilst those data are searched. Once the data have been searched they shall be deleted. Such uses shall not be considered to be unlawful downloading or copying of SIS II data. Europol shall not copy alert data or additional data issued by Member States or from CS-SIS II into other Europol systems.

7.   For the purpose of verifying the lawfulness of data processing, self-monitoring and ensuring proper data security and integrity, Europol shall keep logs of every access to and search in SIS II in accordance with the provisions of Article 12. Such logs and documentation shall not be considered to be unlawful downloading or copying of part of SIS II.

8.   Member States shall inform Europol through the exchange of supplementary information of any hit on alerts related to terrorist offences. Member States may exceptionally not inform Europol if doing so would jeopardise current investigations, the safety of an individual or be contrary to essential interests of the security of the issuing Member State.

9.   Paragraph 8 shall apply from the date that Europol is able to receive supplementary information in accordance with paragraph 1.

7.   Without prejudice to paragraph 2, no parts of SIS II shall be connected to any system for data collection and processing operated by the teams referred to in paragraph 1 or by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, nor shall the data in SIS II to which those teams have access be transferred to such a system. No part of SIS II shall be downloaded or copied. The logging of access and searches shall not be considered to be unlawful downloading or copying of SIS II data.

8.   The European Border and Coast Guard Agency shall allow the European Data Protection Supervisor to monitor and review the activities of the teams referred to in this Article in the exercise of their right to access and search data in SIS II.
