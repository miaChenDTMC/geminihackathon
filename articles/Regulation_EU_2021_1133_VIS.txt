REGULATION (EU) 2021/1133 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 7 July 2021

amending Regulations (EU) No 603/2013, (EU) 2016/794, (EU) 2018/1862, (EU) 2019/816 and (EU) 2019/818 as regards the establishment of the conditions for accessing other EU information systems for the purposes of the Visa Information System

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular point (e) of Article 78(2), point (d) of Article 82(1), point (a) of Article 87(2), and Article 88(2) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee

(

1

)

,

After consulting the Committee of the Regions,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure

(

2

)

,

Whereas:

(1)

The Visa Information System (VIS) was established by Council Decision 2004/512/EC

(

3

)

to serve as the technological solution for exchanging visa data between Member States. Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

4

)

laid down the purpose, functionalities and responsibilities for the VIS, as well as the conditions and procedures for the exchange of short-stay visa data between Member States to facilitate the examination of applications for short-stay visas and related decisions. Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

5

)

set out the rules on the registration of biometric identifiers in the VIS. The access of law enforcement authorities of the Member States and of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) to the VIS was established by Council Decision 2008/633/JHA

(

6

)

. That Decision should be integrated into Regulation (EC) No 767/2008, to bring it in line with the current Treaty framework.

(2)

Interoperability between certain EU information systems was established by Regulations (EU) 2019/817

(

7

)

and (EU) 2019/818

(

8

)

of the European Parliament and of the Council so that those systems and their data supplement each other with a view to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of border checks at the external borders of the Union, contributing to preventing and combating illegal immigration and contributing to a high level of security within the area of freedom, security and justice of the Union, including the maintenance of public security and public policy and safeguarding security in the territories of the Member States.

(3)

Interoperability between the EU information systems allows those systems to supplement each other in order to facilitate the correct identification of persons, contribute to fighting identity fraud, improve and harmonise data quality requirements of the relevant EU information systems, facilitate the technical and operational implementation by Member States of existing and future EU information systems, strengthen and simplify the data security and data protection safeguards that govern the relevant EU information systems, streamline the law enforcement access to the VIS, the Entry/Exit System (EES), the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) and Eurodac, and support the purposes of the VIS, Schengen Information System (SIS), the EES, the ETIAS, Eurodac and the European Criminal Records Information System for third-country nationals (ECRIS-TCN).

(4)

The interoperability components cover the VIS, the SIS, the EES, the ETIAS, Eurodac and ECRIS-TCN, as well as Europol data to enable Europol data to be queried simultaneously with those EU information systems. It is therefore appropriate to use those interoperability components for the purpose of carrying out automated queries and when accessing the VIS for law enforcement purposes. The European search portal (ESP) established by Regulation (EU) 2019/818 should be used to enable fast, seamless, efficient, systematic and controlled access by Member States’ authorities to the EU information systems, the Europol data and the Interpol databases needed to perform their tasks, in accordance with their access rights, and to support the objectives of the VIS.

(5)

The ESP will enable the data stored in the VIS and the data stored in the other EU information systems concerned to be queried in parallel.

(6)

The comparison of data stored in the VIS against data stored in other information systems and databases should be automated. If such a comparison reveals the existence of a correspondence, known as a ‘hit’, between any of the personal data or combination thereof in an application and a record, file or alert in those other information systems or databases, or with personal data in the ETIAS watchlist, the application should be verified manually by an operator from the competent authority. The assessment of hits performed by the competent authority should be taken into account for the decision whether to issue a short-stay visa, a long-stay visa or a residence permit.

(7)

This Regulation lays down the manner in which interoperability and the conditions for the consultation of the data stored in SIS, Eurodac and ECRIS-TCN as well as of the Europol data by the VIS automated process for the purpose of identifying hits are to be implemented. As a result, it is necessary to amend Regulations (EU) No 603/2013

(

9

)

, (EU) 2016/794

(

10

)

, (EU) 2018/1862

(

11

)

, (EU) 2019/816

(

12

)

and (EU) 2019/818 of the European Parliament and of the Council in order to connect the VIS to the other EU information systems and to Europol data.

(8)

The conditions under which, on the one hand, the visa authorities are able to consult data stored in Eurodac and, on the other, the VIS designated authorities are able to consult Europol data, certain SIS data and data stored in ECRIS-TCN for the purposes of the VIS should be safeguarded by clear and precise rules regarding the access by those authorities to those data, the type of queries and categories of data, all of which should be limited to what is strictly necessary for the performance of the duties of those authorities. In the same vein, the data stored in the VIS application file should be visible only to those Member States that are operating the underlying information systems in accordance with the arrangements for their participation.

(9)

Regulation (EU) 2021/1134 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

13

)

allocates new tasks to Europol such as the provision of opinions following consultation requests by the VIS designated authorities and the ETIAS National Units. To implement those tasks, it is therefore necessary to amend Regulation (EU) 2016/794 accordingly.

(10)

In order to support the VIS objective of assessing whether an applicant for a short-stay visa, a long-stay visa or a residence permit could pose a threat to public policy or public security, the VIS should be able to verify whether any correspondence exists between data in the VIS application files and the ECRIS-TCN data in the Common Identity Repository (CIR) established by Regulation (EU) 2019/818 in regard to which Member States hold information on third-country nationals and stateless persons concerning convictions for a terrorist offence or any other criminal offence listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) 2018/1240 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

14

)

if it is punishable by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least three years under national law.

(11)

A hit indicated by ECRIS-TCN should not by itself be taken to mean that the third-country national concerned has been convicted in the Member States that are indicated. The existence of previous convictions should be confirmed only on the basis of information received from the criminal records of the Member States concerned.

(12)

This Regulation is without prejudice to Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

15

)

.

(13)

In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
