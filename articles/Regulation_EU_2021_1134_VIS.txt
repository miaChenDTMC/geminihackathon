REGULATION (EU) 2021/1134 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 7 July 2021

amending Regulations (EC) No 767/2008, (EC) No 810/2009, (EU) 2016/399, (EU) 2017/2226, (EU) 2018/1240, (EU) 2018/1860, (EU) 2018/1861, (EU) 2019/817 and (EU) 2019/1896 of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Decisions 2004/512/EC and 2008/633/JHA, for the purpose of reforming the Visa Information System

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular points (a), (b), (d) and (e) of Article 77(2) and point (a) of Article 87(2) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee

(

)

,

After consulting the Committee of the Regions,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure

(

)

,

Whereas:

(1)

The Visa Information System (VIS) was established by Council Decision 2004/512/EC

(

3

)

to serve as the technological solution for exchanging visa data between Member States. Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

4

)

laid down the purpose, functionalities and responsibilities for the VIS, as well as the conditions and procedures for the exchange of short-stay visa data between Member States to facilitate the examination of applications for short-stay visas and related decisions. Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

5

)

set out the rules on the registration of biometric identifiers in the VIS. Council Decision 2008/633/JHA

(

6

)

laid down the conditions under which Member States’ designated authorities and the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) are able to obtain access for the consultation of the VIS for the purposes of preventing, detecting and investigating terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences. The VIS started operations on 11 October 2011 and was gradually rolled out in all Member States’ consulates between October 2011 and February 2016.

(2)

The objectives of the VIS are to improve the implementation of the common visa policy, consular cooperation and consultation between central visa authorities by facilitating the exchange of data between Member States on applications and on the decisions relating thereto, in order to: facilitate the visa application procedure; prevent ‘visa shopping’; facilitate the fight against identity fraud; facilitate checks at external border crossing points and within the Member States’ territory; assist in the identification of any person who does not or no longer fulfils the conditions for entry to, stay or residence on the territory of the Member States; facilitate the determination of the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection under Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

)

; and contribute to the prevention of threats to the internal security of any of the Member States.

(3)

In its communication of 6 April 2016 entitled ‘Stronger and Smarter Information Systems for Borders and Security’, the Commission outlined the need for the Union to strengthen and improve its information systems, data architecture and information exchange in the area of border management, law enforcement and counter-terrorism and emphasised the need to improve the interoperability of information systems. The Communication also identified a need to address information gaps, including on third-country nationals holding a long-stay visa.

(4)

In its 2016 roadmap to enhance information exchange and information management and in its conclusions of 8 June 2017 on the way forward to improve information exchange and ensure the interoperability of EU information systems, the Council invited the Commission to undertake a feasibility study for the establishment of a central EU repository containing information on long-stay visas and residence permits. On that basis, the Commission conducted two studies which concluded that developing a repository would be technically feasible and that re-using the VIS structure would be the best technical option, and that it would be necessary and proportionate to extend the scope of the VIS to include information on long-stay visas and residence permits.

(5)

In its communication of 27 September 2017 entitled ‘Delivery of the European Agenda on Migration’, the Commission stated that the Union’s common visa policy is not only an essential tool for facilitating tourism and business, but also a key tool to prevent security risks and risks of irregular migration to the Union. In that communication, the Commission acknowledged the need to further adapt the common visa policy to current challenges, taking into account new IT solutions and balancing the benefits of facilitated visa travel with improved migration, security and border management. It stated in that communication that the VIS legal framework would be revised, with the aim of further improving visa processing, including as regards data protection related aspects and access for law enforcement authorities, further expanding the use of the VIS for new categories and uses of data and to make full use of the interoperability instruments.

(6)

In its communication of 14 March 2018 on adapting the common visa policy to new challenges, the Commission reaffirmed that the VIS legal framework would be revised, as part of a broader process of reflection on the interoperability of information systems.

(7)

Article 21 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders

(

8

)

(Schengen Convention) provides holders of valid residence permits or long-stay visas with a right to free movement within the territory of the contracting parties to the Agreement for a period of not more than 90 days in any 180 days, by instituting the mutual recognition of the residence permits and long-stay visas issued by those contracting parties. There are currently no means of checking whether applicants for or holders of such residence permits and long-stay visas could pose a threat to the security of the Member States other than the Member State processing the application for a long-stay visa or residence permit. In order to address the existing information gap, information on applicants for and holders of long-stay visas and residence permits should be stored in the VIS. As regards those documents, the purpose of the VIS should be to support a high level of security, which is particularly important for the Schengen area as an area without internal border controls, by contributing to the assessment of whether an applicant is considered to pose a threat to public policy, internal security or public health. It should also aim to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of checks at the external borders and of checks within the territory of the Member States carried out in accordance with Union or national law. The VIS should also assist in the identification, in particular in order to facilitate the return of any person who does not or no longer fulfils the conditions for entry to, stay or residence on the territory of the Member States. It should also contribute to the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences; ensure the correct identification of persons; facilitate the application of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 and of Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

)

; and support the objectives of the Schengen Information System (SIS).

(8)

Decisions 2004/512/EC and 2008/633/JHA should be integrated into Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 in order to consolidate the rules on the establishment and use of the VIS in a single Regulation.

(9)

Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 should also lay down the architecture of the VIS. The European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) should be responsible for the technical development and operational management of the VIS and its components. Where eu-LISA cooperates with external contractors in any VIS-related tasks, it should closely monitor the activities of the contractor to ensure compliance with Regulation (EC) No 767/2008, in particular provisions on security, confidentiality and data protection. The operational management of the VIS should not be entrusted to private companies or private organisations.

(10)

When adopting Regulation (EC) No 810/2009, it was recognised that the issue of the sufficient reliability of fingerprints of children below the age of 12 for identification and verification purposes and, in particular, how fingerprints evolve with age, would have to be addressed at a later stage on the basis of the results of a study that was to be carried out under the responsibility of the Commission. A study entitled “Fingerprint Recognition for Children”, which was carried out in 2013 by the Joint Research Centre, concluded that fingerprint recognition of children aged between six and 12 years is achievable with a satisfactory level of accuracy under certain conditions. A second study entitled “Automatic fingerprint recognition: from children to elderly” confirmed that finding in December 2017 and provided further insight into the effect of aging on fingerprint quality. On that basis, in 2017 the Commission conducted a further study entitled “Feasibility and implications of lowering the fingerprinting age for children and on storing a scanned copy of the visa applicants’ travel document in the Visa Information System (VIS)”, which was finalised in 2018 and looked into the necessity and proportionality of lowering the fingerprinting age in the visa procedure for children to six years. That study found that lowering the fingerprinting age would contribute better to achieving the VIS objectives, in particular in relation to the facilitation of the fight against identity fraud and of checks at external border crossing points. It also found that lowering the fingerprinting age could bring additional benefits by strengthening the prevention and fight against the abuse of children’s rights, in particular by enabling the identification or verification of the identity of children who are third-country nationals in the Schengen area and who are in a situation where their rights have been, or may be, violated, for example because they are child victims of trafficking in human beings, missing children or unaccompanied minors applying for asylum. At the same time, children are a particularly vulnerable group and collecting their biometric data should be subject to stricter safeguards, including limiting the retention period for data storage, and the purposes for which those data may be used should be limited to situations where it is in the child’s best interests. The study that was finalised in 2018 also showed that fingerprints of elderly persons are of lower quality and medium accuracy and recommended measures to mitigate those shortcomings. Member States should follow the recommendations identified in that study with the objective of improving the quality of fingerprints and biometric matching.

(11)

The best interests of the child are a primary consideration for Member States with respect to all procedures provided for in this Regulation. The child’s well-being, safety and security and the views of the child are to be taken into consideration and given due weight in accordance with the child’s age and maturity. The VIS is particularly relevant where there is a risk of a child being a victim of trafficking.

(12)

The visa procedure and the VIS should benefit from the technological developments related to facial image recognition. Taking live facial images upon submission of applications should be the rule when recording the facial image of applicants in the VIS, also when processing applications for long-stay visas and residence permits, where this is allowed by national law. Taking live facial images upon submission of applications will also contribute to addressing biometric vulnerabilities such as ‘face-morphing’ used for identity fraud. Only facial images taken live should be used for biometric matching.

(13)

Biometric data, which in the context of this Regulation entails fingerprints and facial images, are unique and therefore much more reliable than alphanumeric data for the purpose of identifying a person. However, biometric data constitute sensitive personal data. This Regulation lays down the basis and safeguards for processing such data for the purpose of identifying the persons concerned.

(14)

The personal data provided by the applicant for a short-stay visa should be processed by the VIS to assess whether the entry of the applicant into the territory of the Member States could pose a threat to public policy, internal security or public health and to assess the risk of irregular migration of the applicant. As regards applicants for a long-stay visa or a residence permit, such assessments should be limited to assessing whether the third-country national could pose a threat to public policy, internal security or public health.

(15)

The assessment of such risks cannot be carried out without processing the personal data related to the applicant’s identity, travel document, and other relevant data. Each item of personal data in an application should be compared with the data present in a record, file or alert registered in the following information systems and databases: the VIS, the SIS, the Entry/Exit System (EES), the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), Eurodac, the European Criminal Records Information System for third-country nationals (ECRIS-TCN) as far as convictions related to terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences are concerned, the Europol data, the Interpol Stolen and Lost Travel Document database (Interpol SLTD), the Interpol Travel Documents Associated with Notices database (Interpol TDAWN), the ETIAS watchlist referred to in Regulation (EU) 2018/1240 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

10

)

, and against specific risk indicators. The categories of personal data that should be used for comparison should be limited to the categories of data present in the queried information systems and databases, the ETIAS watchlist or the specific risk indicators.

(16)

Interoperability between certain EU information systems was established by Regulations (EU) 2019/817

(

11

)

and (EU) 2019/818

(

12

)

of the European Parliament and of the Council so that those systems and their data supplement each other with a view to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of border checks at the external borders of the Union, contributing to preventing and combating illegal immigration and contributing to a high level of security within the area of freedom, security and justice of the Union, including the maintenance of public security and public policy and safeguarding security in the territories of the Member States.

(17)

Interoperability between the EU information systems allows those systems to supplement each other in order to facilitate the correct identification of persons, contribute to fighting identity fraud, improve and harmonise data quality requirements of the relevant EU information systems, facilitate the technical and operational implementation by Member States of existing and future EU information systems, strengthen and simplify the data security and data protection safeguards that govern the relevant EU information systems, streamline the law enforcement access to the VIS, the EES, the ETIAS and Eurodac, and support the purposes of the VIS, the SIS, the EES, the ETIAS, Eurodac and the ECRIS-TCN.

(18)

The interoperability components cover the VIS, the SIS, the EES, the ETIAS, Eurodac and the ECRIS-TCN, as well as Europol data to enable Europol data to be queried simultaneously with those EU information systems. It is therefore appropriate to use those interoperability components for the purpose of carrying out automated queries and when accessing the VIS for law enforcement purposes. The European search portal (ESP) established by Regulation (EU) 2019/817 should be used to enable fast, seamless, efficient, systematic and controlled access by Member States’ authorities to the EU information systems, the Europol data and the Interpol databases needed to perform their tasks, in accordance with their access rights, and to support the objectives of the VIS.

(19)

The ESP will enable the data stored in the VIS and the data stored in the other EU information systems concerned to be queried in parallel.

(20)

The comparison of data stored in the VIS against data stored in other information systems and databases should be automated. If such a comparison reveals the existence of a correspondence, known as a ‘hit’, between any of the personal data or combination thereof in an application and a record, file or alert in those other information systems or databases, or with personal data in the ETIAS watchlist, the application should be verified manually by an operator from the competent authority. Depending on the type of data triggering the hit, the hit should be manually verified and assessed by the competent visa or immigration authority, by the ETIAS National Unit referred to in Regulation (EU) 2018/1240 or by a central authority designated by the Member State (VIS designated authority). As hits generated by law enforcement or judicial systems or databases are generally more sensitive, they should not be verified and assessed by consulates, but rather by the VIS designated authorities or the ETIAS National Units. Member States should be able to designate more than one authority as a VIS designated authority. The SIRENE Bureau should be designated as the VIS designated authority only if it is allocated sufficient additional resources enabling it to fulfil that task. The assessment of the hits performed by the competent authority should be taken into account for the decision whether to issue a short-stay visa or when assessing whether the applicant for a long-stay visa or residence permit could pose a threat to the public policy, internal security or public health of the Member States.

(21)

As the VIS will be part of the common framework of interoperability, it is necessary that the development of new features and processes be fully coherent with features and processes in the other EU information systems that are part of that framework. The automated queries that will be launched by the VIS with the purpose of finding whether information on applicants for a visa or residence permit is known to other EU information systems will result in hits against those other EU information systems. A similar system of queries is currently present in only one other system, namely ETIAS, while the concept of hits is also found in the EES, including in relation to the EES-VIS interoperability, and in the SIS.

(22)

The refusal of an application for a short-stay visa should not be based solely on the automated processing of personal data in the applications for a visa.

(23)

Applicants who have been refused a short-stay visa on the basis of information resulting from VIS processing should have the right to appeal. Appeals should be conducted in the Member State that has taken the decision on the application and in accordance with the national law of that Member State. The safeguards and rules on appeal under Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 apply.

(24)

The use of specific risk indicators corresponding to previously identified security, irregular migration or high epidemic risks should contribute to analysing the application for a short-stay visa. The criteria used for defining the specific risk indicators should in no circumstances be based solely on the applicant’s sex or age. They are not in any circumstances to be based on information revealing the applicant’s race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, political or any other opinions, religion or philosophical belief, trade union membership, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability or sexual orientation. To the extent possible and where relevant, the rules, procedures and governance structure for the specific risk indicators should be aligned with those for the ETIAS screening rules, as laid down in Articles 9, 10 and 33 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1240. The specific risk indicators should be defined, established, assessed

ex ante

, implemented, evaluated

ex post

, revised and deleted by the ETIAS Central Unit referred to in Regulation (EU) 2018/1240 following the consultation of a VIS Screening Board composed of representatives of the central visa authorities and the agencies involved. To help ensure the respect of fundamental rights in the implementation of the specific risk indicators, a VIS Fundamental Rights Guidance Board should be established. The secretariat for its meetings should be provided by the Fundamental Rights Officer of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency.

(25)

The continuous emergence of new forms of security risks, new patterns of irregular migration and high epidemic risks requires effective responses and needs to be countered with modern means. Since modern means entail the processing of important amounts of personal data, appropriate safeguards should be introduced to keep the interference with the rights to respect for private and family life and to the protection of personal data limited to what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society.

(26)

It should be ensured that at least a similar level of checks is applied to applicants for a short-stay visa, or third-country nationals who apply for a long-stay visa or a residence permit, as for third-country nationals applying for a travel authorisation in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1240. To that end, the ETIAS watchlist, consisting of data related to persons who are suspected of having committed or taken part in a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence or persons regarding whom there are factual indications or reasonable grounds to believe that they will commit a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence, should be used for verifications in respect of those categories of third-country nationals as well.

(27)

In order to fulfil their obligation under the Schengen Convention, international carriers should verify whether third-country nationals who are required to hold a short-stay visa, a long-stay visa or a residence permit are in possession of a valid short-stay visa, long-stay visa or residence permit by sending a query to the VIS. That verification should be made possible through the daily extraction of VIS data into a separate read-only database allowing the extraction of a minimum necessary subset of data to enable a query leading to an OK/NOT OK answer. The application file itself should not be accessible to international carriers. The technical specifications for accessing the VIS through the carrier gateway should limit the impact on passenger travel and international carriers to the extent possible. To that end, integration with the carrier gateways for the EES and ETIAS should be considered.

(28)

With a view to limiting the impact of the obligations set out in this Regulation on international carriers transporting groups overland by coach, user-friendly mobile solutions should be made available.

(29)

The assessment of the appropriateness, compatibility and coherence of provisions referred to in Article 26 of the Schengen Convention as referred to in the preamble to Regulation (EU) 2018/1240 for the purposes of the ETIAS regarding the provisions for overland transport by coaches should be extended to cover also the relevant provisions of this Regulation.

(30)

Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 should specify the authorities of the Member States which are authorised to have access to the VIS to enter, amend, erase or consult data on applications for and decisions on long-stay visas and residence permits for the specific purposes set out in that Regulation, and, to the extent necessary, for the performance of their tasks.

(31)

Any processing of VIS data on long-stay visas and residence permits should be proportionate to the objectives pursued and necessary for the performance of tasks of the competent authorities. Therefore, access by certain competent authorities to data regarding persons who have held valid residence permits recorded in the VIS for a period of 10 years or more without interruption should be restricted.

(32)

When using the VIS, the competent authorities should ensure that the human dignity and integrity of the persons whose data are requested are respected and that they do not discriminate against such persons on grounds of sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation.

(33)

It is imperative that law enforcement authorities have the most up-to-date information if they are to perform their tasks in the fight against terrorism and other serious forms of crime. The access of law enforcement authorities of the Member States and of Europol to the VIS was established by Decision 2008/633/JHA. That Decision should be integrated into Regulation (EC) No 767/2008, to bring it in line with the current Treaty framework.

(34)

Access to VIS data for law enforcement purposes has already proven to be useful in identifying people who died in violent circumstances or helping investigators to make substantial progress in cases related to trafficking in human beings, terrorism or drug trafficking. Therefore, the VIS data related to long stays should also be available to the designated authorities of the Member States and to Europol, subject to the conditions set out in this Regulation.

(35)

Given that Europol plays a key role with respect to cooperation between Member States’ authorities in the field of cross-border crime investigation in supporting Union-wide crime prevention, analyses and investigation, Europol’s current access to the VIS within the framework of its tasks should be codified and streamlined, taking into account also recent developments of the legal framework such as Regulation (EU) 2016/794 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

13

)

.

(36)

Access to the VIS for the purpose of preventing, detecting or investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences constitutes an interference with the fundamental rights to respect for private and family life and to the protection of personal data of persons whose personal data are processed in the VIS. Any such interference must be carried out in accordance with the law, which must be formulated with sufficient precision to allow individuals to adjust their conduct and which must protect individuals against arbitrariness and indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise. Any such interference with fundamental rights is possible only if necessary in a democratic society to protect a legitimate and proportionate interest and if it is proportionate to the legitimate objective to be achieved.

(37)

Regulation (EU) 2019/817 provides the possibility for a Member State police authority which has been so empowered by national legislation, to identify a person by means of the biometric data of that person taken during an identity check. However, specific circumstances may exist where the identification of a person is necessary in the interests of that person. Such cases include situations where a missing or abducted person or a victim of human trafficking is found. In such cases, law enforcement authorities should be provided with quick access to VIS data in order to enable the fast and reliable identification of the person, without the need to fulfil all the preconditions and additional safeguards for law enforcement access.

(38)

The comparison of data on the basis of a latent fingerprint, which is the dactyloscopic trace that might be found at a crime scene, is fundamental in the field of police cooperation. The possibility to compare a latent fingerprint with the fingerprint data which is stored in the VIS where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the perpetrator or victim is registered in the VIS should provide the law enforcement authorities with a very valuable tool in preventing, detecting or investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences, when for example the only evidence at a crime scene is latent fingerprints.

(39)

It is necessary to designate the competent authorities of the Member States as well as the central access point through which the requests for access to VIS data are made and to keep a list of the operating units within the designated authorities that are authorised to request such access for the specific purposes for the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences.

(40)

Requests for access to data stored in the VIS Central System should be made by the operating units within the designated authorities to the central access point and should be justified. The operating units within the designated authorities that are authorised to request access to VIS data should not act as a verifying authority. The central access points should act independently of the designated authorities and should be responsible for ensuring, in an independent manner, strict compliance with the conditions for access as established in this Regulation. In exceptional cases of urgency, where early access is necessary to respond to a specific and actual threat related to terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences, the central access point should process the request for access immediately and carry out the verification only afterwards.

(41)

To protect personal data and to exclude the possibility of systematic searches by law enforcement authorities, the processing of VIS data should only take place in specific cases and when it is necessary for the purpose of preventing, detecting or investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences. The designated authorities and Europol should only request access to the VIS when they have reasonable grounds to believe that such access will provide information that will substantially assist them in preventing, detecting or investigating a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence.

(42)

The personal data stored in the VIS should be kept for no longer than is necessary for the purposes of the VIS. It is appropriate to store the data related to third-country nationals for a period of five years in order to enable data to be taken into account for the assessment of the applications for short-stay visas, to enable detection of overstay after the end of the validity period and in order to conduct security assessments of third-country nationals who obtained them. The data on previous uses of a document could facilitate the issuance of future short-stay visas. A shorter storage period would not be sufficient for ensuring the stated purposes. The data should be erased after a period of five years, unless there are grounds to erase them earlier.

(43)

Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

14

)

applies to the processing of personal data by the Member States in application of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008. The processing of personal data by law enforcement authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties is governed by Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

15

)

.

(44)

Members of the European Border and Coast Guard (EBCG) teams, as well as teams of staff involved in return-related tasks are entitled by Regulation (EU) 2019/1896 of the European Parliament and the Council

(

16

)

to consult EU information systems and databases where necessary for fulfilling their operational tasks specified in the operational plan on border checks, border surveillance and return, under the authority of the host Member State. For the purpose of facilitating that consultation and enabling effective access by the teams to VIS data, they should be given access to the VIS. Such access should follow the conditions and limitations of access applicable to the Member States’ authorities competent under each specific purpose for which VIS data can be consulted.

(45)

The return of third-country nationals who do not fulfil or no longer fulfil the conditions for entry to, stay or residence on the territory of the Member States in accordance with Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

17

)

, is an essential component of the comprehensive efforts to tackle irregular migration and represents an important reason of substantial public interest.

(46)

In order to enhance third countries’ cooperation on readmission of irregular migrants and to facilitate the return of illegally staying third-country nationals whose data might be stored in the VIS, copies of the travel document of applicants should be stored in the VIS. Contrary to information extracted from the VIS, copies of travel documents are a proof of nationality more widely recognised by third countries.

(47)

Personal data stored in the VIS should not be transferred or made available to any third country or international organisation. As an exception to that rule, however, it should be possible to transfer such personal data to a third country or to an international organisation where such a transfer is subject to strict conditions and necessary in individual cases in order to assist with the identification of a third-country national in relation to his or her return or resettlement. In the absence of an adequacy decision by means of an implementing act pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or of appropriate safeguards to which transfers are subject pursuant to that Regulation, it should exceptionally be possible to transfer VIS data to a third country or to an international organisation for the purposes of return or resettlement only where the transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest as referred to in that Regulation.

(48)

It should also be possible to transfer personal data obtained by Member States pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 to a third country in an exceptional case of urgency, where there is an imminent danger associated with a terrorist offence or where there is an imminent danger to the life of a person associated with a serious criminal offence. An imminent danger to the life of a person should be understood as covering a danger arising from a serious criminal offence committed against that person such as grievous bodily injury, illicit trade in human organs or tissue, kidnapping, illegal restraint and hostage-taking, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, and rape. Such data should be transferred to a third country only if the reciprocal provision of any information on visa records held by the requesting third country to the Member States operating the VIS is ensured.

(49)

Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and the Council

(

18

)

applies to the activities of the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies when carrying out the tasks for which they are responsible with regard to the operational management of the VIS.

(50)

The consultation of the list of travel documents which entitle the holder to cross the external borders and which may be endorsed with a visa, as established by Decision No 1105/2011/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council

(

19

)

, is a compulsory element of the short-stay visa examination procedure. Visa authorities should systematically implement that obligation and therefore that list should be incorporated in the VIS to enable automatic verification of the recognition of the applicant’s travel document.

(51)

Without prejudice to Member States’ responsibility for the accuracy of data entered in the VIS, eu-LISA should be responsible for reinforcing data quality by developing and maintaining a central data quality monitoring tool, and for providing reports at regular intervals to the Member States.

(52)

In order to enable better monitoring of the use of the VIS to analyse trends concerning migratory pressure and border management, eu-LISA should be able to develop a capability for statistical reporting to the Member States, the Commission, and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency without jeopardising data integrity. Therefore, eu-LISA should store certain statistics in the central repository for reporting and statistics in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/817. None of the statistics produced should contain personal data.

(53)

This Regulation is without prejudice to the application of Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council

Specific provisions should apply to third-country nationals who are subject to a visa requirement, who are family members of a Union citizen to whom Directive 2004/38/EC applies or of a third-country national enjoying the right of free movement under Union law, and who do not hold a residence card as referred to in Directive 2004/38/EC. Article 21(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that every Union citizen has the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in the Treaties and laid down by the measures adopted to give those limitations and conditions effect. Those limitations and conditions are laid down in Directive 2004/38/EC.

(55)

As confirmed by the Court of Justice of the European Union, such family members not only have the right to enter the territory of the Member State but also to obtain an entry visa for that purpose. Member States must grant such persons every facility to obtain the necessary visas which must be issued free of charge as soon as possible and on the basis of an accelerated procedure.

(56)

The right to obtain a visa is not unconditional as it can be denied to family members on grounds of public policy, public security or public health pursuant to Directive 2004/38/EC. Against that background, the personal data of family members can be verified only where the data relate to their identification and their status and only insofar as those data are relevant for the assessment of the security or public health threat that they could represent. The examination of the visa applications of such family members should be made exclusively against the security or public health concerns, and not those related to migration risks.

(57)

Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the need to ensure the implementation of a common policy on visas, a high level of security within the area without controls at the internal borders and the gradual establishment of an integrated management system for the external borders, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

(58)

This Regulation establishes strict access rules to the VIS and the necessary safeguards. It also provides for individuals’ rights of access, rectification, erasure and remedies in particular the right to a judicial remedy and the supervision of data processing operations by independent public authorities. Additional safeguards are introduced by this Regulation to cover for the specific needs of the new categories of data that will be processed by the VIS. This Regulation therefore respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to human dignity, the right to liberty and security, the respect for private and family life, the protection of personal data, the right to asylum and protection of the principle of non-refoulement and protection in the event of removal, expulsion or extradition, the right to non-discrimination, the rights of the child and the right to an effective remedy.

(59)

In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen

acquis

, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 4 of that Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.

(60)

This Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen

acquis

in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC

(

; Ireland is therefore not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
