REGULATION (EU) No 167/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 5 February 2013

on the approval and market surveillance of agricultural and forestry vehicles

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee

(

1

)

,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure

(

2

)

,

Whereas:

(1)

In order to promote the internal market, a comprehensive Union type-approval system for tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed equipment was established by Directive 2003/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on type-approval of agricultural or forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units

(

3

)

.

(2)

For the purposes of the development and operation of the internal market of the Union, it is appropriate to replace the approval systems of the Member States with a Union type-approval procedure based on the principle of total harmonisation, while at the same time taking due account of cost-benefit considerations, with special attention given to small and medium-sized enterprises.

(3)

Following the request of the European Parliament and with the aim of simplifying and accelerating the adoption of type-approval legislation, a new regulatory approach has been introduced in Union vehicle type-approval legislation in accordance with which the legislator in the ordinary legislative procedure sets out the fundamental rules and principles only and delegates the power to adopt delegated acts concerning further technical details to the Commission. With regard to substantive requirements, this Regulation should therefore lay down only fundamental provisions on functional safety, occupational safety and environmental performance and delegate to the Commission the power to lay down the technical specifications in delegated acts.

(4)

The requirements of this Regulation are in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Commission Communication of 5 June 2002 entitled ‘Action plan “Simplifying and improving the regulatory environment”’.

(5)

It is of particular importance that future measures proposed on the basis of this Regulation or procedures to be implemented in application of it comply with the principles which have been restated in the report published by the Commission in 2006 entitled ‘CARS 21: A Competitive Automotive Regulatory System for the 21st century’ (‘CARS 21’). In particular, for the purposes of better regulation and simplification and in order to avoid constant updating of existing Union legislation on issues of technical specifications, this Regulation should make reference to existing international standards and regulations which are available to the public without reproducing them in the Union legal framework.

(6)

Since neither Directive 97/68/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1997 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery

(

4

)

and Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on machinery

(

5

)

nor this Regulation provide for design and construction requirements to ensure safety on the road of self-propelled non-road mobile machinery intended for use in particular in agriculture and forestry, the Commission should assess the need for harmonising the laws of the Member States in that area and consider proposing a legislative measure in order to ensure a high level of safety, taking into account existing Union legislation.

(7)

This Regulation should be without prejudice to measures at national or Union level regarding the use of agricultural and forestry vehicles on the road, such as specific driver’s licence requirements, limitations of maximum speed or measures regulating the access to certain roads.

(8)

Directive 2003/37/EC in a first stage limited the mandatory application of the EC whole-vehicle type-approval procedure to the vehicle categories T1, T2 and T3 and did not provide for all requirements necessary in order to apply for EC whole-vehicle type-approval on a voluntary basis for other categories. In order to complete the internal market and to ensure that it functions properly, this Regulation should allow manufacturers to apply for EU whole-vehicle type-approval for all categories covered by this Regulation on a voluntary basis, thereby enabling them to benefit from the advantages of the internal market by means of the EU type-approval.

(9)

Directive 2003/37/EC provided for the EC whole-vehicle type-approval of all-terrain vehicles and side-by-side vehicles as tractors. Those vehicle types should therefore also be covered by this Regulation, provided that the type of vehicle concerned falls within a vehicle category as referred to in this Regulation and complies with all requirements of this Regulation.

(10)

The national authorities’ obligations laid down in the market surveillance provisions of this Regulation are more specific than the corresponding provisions of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products

(

6

)

.

(11)

In order to ensure a high level of functional safety, occupational safety and environmental protection, the technical requirements and environmental standards applicable to vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units with regard to type-approval should be harmonised.

(12)

It is appropriate to establish the principle that vehicles must be designed, constructed and assembled so as to minimise the risk of injury to the vehicle occupants and to other road users. For that purpose, it is necessary that manufacturers ensure that vehicles comply with the relevant requirements set out in this Regulation. Those provisions should include, but not be limited to, requirements relating to vehicle structural integrity, systems to aid the driver’s control of the vehicle, systems to provide the driver with visibility and information on the state of the vehicle and the surrounding area, vehicle lighting systems, vehicle occupant protection systems, the vehicle exterior and accessories, vehicle masses and dimensions and vehicle tyres.

(13)

In order to ensure that the procedure for monitoring conformity of production, which is one of the cornerstones of the EU type-approval system, has been correctly implemented and functions properly, manufacturers should be regularly checked by a competent authority or by an appropriately qualified technical service designated for that purpose.

(14)

In certain limited cases, it is appropriate to allow for national small series type-approval. That should, however, be restricted to limited numbers of vehicles. Therefore it is necessary to define precisely the concept of small series in terms of the number of vehicles to be produced.

(15)

The main objective of Union legislation on the approval of vehicles is to ensure that new vehicles, components and separate technical units placed on the market provide a high level of safety and environmental protection. That objective should not be impaired by the fitting of certain parts or equipment after vehicles have been placed on the market or have entered into service. Thus, appropriate measures should be taken in order to make sure that parts or equipment which can be fitted to vehicles and which are capable of significantly impairing the functioning of systems that are essential in terms of safety or environmental protection, are subject to prior control by an approval authority before they are placed on the market. Those measures should consist of technical provisions concerning the requirements that those parts or equipment have to comply with.

(16)

Such measures should only apply to a limited number of parts and equipment, the list of which should be established by the Commission in an implementing act after it has consulted the stakeholders. The measures should ensure that the parts or equipment in question do not impair the safety or environmental performance of the vehicle, while at the same time preserving wherever possible competition in the aftermarket.

(17)

The Union is a contracting party of the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions (‘Revised 1958 Agreement’)

(

7

)

. In order to simplify the type-approval legislation in line with the recommendations of CARS 21, it is appropriate to repeal all separate Directives without reducing the level of protection. The requirements set out in those Directives should be carried over to this Regulation or the delegated acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation and should be replaced, where appropriate, with references to the corresponding United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) regulations which the Union has voted in favour of or to which the Union has acceded and which are annexed to the Revised 1958 Agreement. To reduce the administrative burden of the type-approval process, vehicle manufacturers should be allowed to seek type-approval in accordance with this Regulation, where appropriate, directly by means of obtaining approval to the relevant UNECE regulations referred to in Annex I or the delegated acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation.

(18)

Consequently, UNECE regulations and the amendments thereto on which the Union has voted in favour, in application of Decision 97/836/EC, should be incorporated within the EU type-approval legislation. Accordingly, the power should be delegated to the Commission to adopt the necessary adaptations to Annex I to this Regulation or the delegated acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation.

(19)

As an alternative, reference could be made in the delegated acts to Codes established by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) or to CEN/Cenelec or ISO standards which are directly available to the public and referenced therein.

(20)

It is important that manufacturers supply relevant information to vehicle owners in order to prevent misuse of safety devices.

(21)

In order to allow manufacturers of components or separate technical units to apply for EU type-approval for components or separate technical units or for authorisation for parts or equipment, it is also important for these manufacturers to have access to certain information that is available only from the vehicle manufacturer, such as the technical information, including drawings, required for the development of parts for the aftermarket.

(22)

Non-discriminatory access to vehicle repair information, via a standardised format which can be used to retrieve the technical information, and effective competition on the market for vehicle repair and maintenance information services are necessary to improve the functioning of the internal market, particularly as regards the free movement of goods, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services. A great proportion of such information is related to on-board diagnostic systems and their interaction with other vehicle systems. It is appropriate to lay down technical specifications that the websites of the manufacturers should follow, along with targeted measures to ensure reasonable access for small and medium-sized enterprises.

(23)

Vehicle manufacturers should also be permitted to fulfil their obligations to grant access to repair and maintenance information on the communication protocols between tractors and towed or mounted equipment, as defined in ISO 11783, by providing on the manufacturer’s website a link to a website set up jointly by several manufacturers or a consortium of manufacturers.

(24)

In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers

(

8

)

.

(25)

In order to supplement this Regulation with further technical details, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of functional safety, construction requirements, environmental and propulsion performance, access to repair and maintenance information and appointment and specific authorised tasks of technical services. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.

(26)

Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and the delegated or implementing acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

(27)

While nothing in this Regulation prevents Member States from continuing to apply their respective individual approval systems, the Commission should report to the European Parliament and the Council on the operation of these national systems, based on information provided by Member States, in order to reconsider the question of whether to submit a legislative proposal for the harmonisation of the individual approval system at Union level.

(30)

Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to lay down harmonised rules on the administrative and technical requirements for the type-approval and on market surveillance of agricultural and forestry vehicles, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, and can therefore, by reason of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

CHAPTER V

CONDUCT OF EU TYPE-APPROVAL PROCEDURES

Article 24

General provisions

1.   Approval authorities shall grant an EU type-approval only after verifying the conformity of production arrangements referred to in Article 28 and the compliance of the type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit with the applicable requirements.

2.   EU type-approvals shall be granted in accordance with this Chapter.

3.   If an approval authority finds that a type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit, though conforming to the required provisions, presents a serious risk to safety or may seriously harm the environment or public health or presents a serious risk to occupational safety, it may refuse to grant EU type-approval. In that case, it shall immediately send to the approval authorities of the other Member States and the Commission a detailed file explaining the reasons for its decision and setting out the evidence for its findings.

4.   EU type-approval certificates shall be numbered in accordance with a harmonised system laid down by the Commission by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 69(2). The first such implementing acts shall be adopted by 31 December 2014.

5.   The approval authority shall, within one month of issuing the EU type-approval certificate, send to the approval authorities of the other Member States a copy of the EU vehicle type-approval certificate, together with the attachments, for each type of vehicle which it has approved by means of a common secure electronic exchange system. The copy may also take the form of a secure electronic file.

6.   The approval authority shall without delay inform the approval authorities of the other Member States of its refusal or withdrawal of any vehicle approval, together with the reasons for its decision.

7.   At three-monthly intervals, the approval authority shall send to the approval authorities of the other Member States a list of the EU type-approvals it has granted, amended, refused to grant or withdrawn for systems, components or separate technical units during the preceding period.

8.   If so requested by an approval authority of another Member State, the approval authority which has granted an EU type-approval shall, within one month of receiving that request, send to the former a copy of the requested EU type-approval certificate, together with the attachments by means of a common secure electronic exchange system. The copy may also take the form of a secure electronic file.

9.   If so requested by the Commission, the approval authority shall submit the information referred to in paragraphs 5 to 8 to the Commission as well.

10.   The approval authority shall put together an information package consisting of the information folder accompanied by the test reports and all other documents added by the technical service or by the approval authority to the information folder in the course of carrying out their functions. The information package shall contain an index listing its contents, suitably numbered or otherwise marked so as to identify clearly all the pages and the format of each document such as to present a record of the successive steps in the management of the EU type-approval, in particular the dates of revisions and updating. The approval authority shall keep information contained in the information package available for a period of 10 years after the end of validity of the approval concerned.

Article 25

Specific provisions concerning the EU type-approval certificate

1.   The EU type-approval certificate shall contain, as attachments, the following:

(a)

the information package referred to in Article 24(10);

(b)

the test results;

(c)

the name(s) and specimen(s) of the signature(s) of the person(s) authorised to sign certificates of conformity and a statement of their position in the company;

(d)

in the case of an EU whole-vehicle type-approval, a filled-out specimen of the certificate of conformity.

2.   The EU type-approval certificate shall be issued on the basis of the template laid down by the Commission by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 69(2). The first such implementing acts shall be adopted by 31 December 2014.

3.   In respect of each type of vehicle, the approval authority shall:

(a)

complete all the relevant sections of the EU type-approval certificate, including the test results sheet appended thereto;

(b)

compile the index to the information package;

(c)

issue the completed certificate, together with its attachments, to the applicant without delay.

The Commission shall lay down the template for the test results sheet referred to in point (a) by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 69(2). The first such implementing acts shall be adopted by 31 December 2014.

4.   In the case of an EU type-approval for which, in accordance with Article 35, restrictions have been imposed as to its validity, or certain provisions of this Regulation or the delegated and implementing acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation have been waived, the EU type-approval certificate shall specify those restrictions or waivers.

5.   Where the manufacturer chooses the mixed type-approval procedure, the approval authority shall complete the information package with the references to the test reports, established by the implementing acts referred to in Article 27(1), for which no EU type-approval certificate is available.

6.   Where the manufacturer chooses the single-step type-approval procedure, the approval authority shall establish a list of applicable requirements or acts and append that list to the EU type-approval certificate. The Commission shall adopt the template for such a list by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 69(2). The first such implementing acts shall be adopted by 31 December 2014.

Article 26

Specific provisions concerning systems, components or separate technical units

1.   EU type-approval shall be granted in respect of a system which conforms to the particulars in the information folder and which meets the technical requirements laid down in the relevant acts listed in Annex I.

2.   EU type-approval for a component or separate technical unit shall be granted in respect of a component or separate technical unit that conforms to the particulars in the information folder and which meets the technical requirements laid down in the relevant acts listed in Annex I.

3.   Where components or separate technical units, whether or not intended for repair, servicing or maintenance, are also covered by a system type-approval with respect to a vehicle, no additional component or separate technical unit approval shall be required unless provided for under the relevant acts listed in Annex I.

4.   Where a component or separate technical unit fulfils its function or offers a specific feature only in conjunction with other parts of the vehicle, thereby making it possible to verify compliance with the requirements only when the component or separate technical unit is operating in conjunction with those other vehicle parts, the scope of the EU type-approval of the component or the separate technical unit shall be restricted accordingly.

In such cases, the EU type-approval certificate shall specify any restriction on the use of the component or separate technical unit and shall indicate the special conditions for its mounting.

Where such a component or separate technical unit is fitted by the vehicle manufacturer, compliance with any applicable restrictions on use or conditions for mounting shall be verified at the time when the vehicle is approved.

Article 27

Tests required for EU type-approval

1.   Compliance with the technical prescriptions laid down in this Regulation and in the acts listed in Annex I shall be demonstrated by means of appropriate tests performed by designated technical services.

The test procedures referred to in the first subparagraph and the specific equipment and tools prescribed to perform those tests shall be those laid down in the relevant acts listed in Annex I.

The format of the test report shall comply with the general requirements as laid down by the Commission by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 69(2). The first such implementing acts shall be adopted by 31 December 2014.

2.   The manufacturer shall make available to the approval authority as many vehicles, components or separate technical units as are required under the relevant acts listed in Annex I for the performance of the required tests.

However, the manufacturer may select, in agreement with the approval authority, a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit which, while not representative of the type to be approved, combines a number of the most unfavourable features with regard to the required level of performance. Virtual testing methods may be used to aid decision-making during the selection process.

4.   Subject to the agreement of the approval authority, virtual testing methods may be used as alternatives to the test procedures referred to in paragraph 1 at the request of the manufacturer with respect to those requirements established in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to paragraph 6.

5.   Virtual testing methods shall fulfil the conditions set out in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to paragraph 6.

6.   In order to ensure that the results obtained through virtual testing are as meaningful as those obtained through physical testing, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 71 concerning the requirements which can be subject to virtual testing and the conditions under which the virtual testing are to be performed. When adopting those delegated acts, the Commission shall take as a basis the requirements and procedures provided for in Annex XVI to Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (Framework Directive)

2.   An approval authority which grants a whole-vehicle type-approval shall take the necessary measures to verify that certificates of conformity issued by the manufacturer conform to Article 33. To that end, the approval authority shall verify that a sufficient number of samples of certificates of conformity conform to Article 33 and that the manufacturer has made adequate arrangements to ensure that the data in the certificates of conformity are correct.

3.   An approval authority which has granted an EU type-approval shall take the necessary measures in relation to that approval to verify, if necessary in cooperation with the approval authorities of the other Member States, that the arrangements referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 continue to be adequate so that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units in production will continue to conform to the approved type and that certificates of conformity continue to comply with Article 33.

4.   In order to verify that a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit conforms to the approved type, the approval authority which has granted the EU type-approval may carry out any of the checks or tests, required for the EU type-approval, on samples taken at the premises of the manufacturer, including production facilities.

5.   When an approval authority which has granted an EU type-approval establishes that the arrangements referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 are not being applied, deviate significantly from the arrangements and control plans agreed, have ceased to be applied or are no longer considered to be adequate, even though production is continued, it shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the procedure for conformity of production is followed correctly or shall withdraw the type-approval.

6.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 71 concerning the detailed arrangements with regard to conformity of production. The first such delegated acts shall be adopted by 31 December 2014.

CHAPTER VI

General provisions

1.   The manufacturer shall inform without delay the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval of any change in the particulars recorded in the information package.

That approval authority shall decide which of the procedures laid down in Article 30 is to be followed.

Where necessary, the approval authority may decide, after consulting the manufacturer, that a new EU type-approval is to be granted.

2.   An application for the amendment of an EU type-approval shall be submitted exclusively to the approval authority that granted the original EU type-approval.

3.   If the approval authority finds that, for the purposes of making an amendment, inspections or tests need to be repeated, it shall inform the manufacturer accordingly.

The procedures referred to in Article 30 shall apply only if, on the basis of those inspections or tests, the approval authority concludes that the requirements for EU type-approval continue to be fulfilled.

Article 30

Revisions and extensions of EU type-approvals

1.   If particulars recorded in the information package have changed, without requiring inspections or tests to be repeated, the amendment shall be designated a ‘revision’.

In such cases, the approval authority shall issue the revised pages of the information package as necessary, marking each revised pages to show clearly the nature of the change and the date of reissue. A consolidated, updated version of the information package, accompanied by a detailed description of the changes, shall be deemed to meet that requirement.

2.   The amendment shall be designated an ‘extension’ when particulars recorded in the information package have changed and any of the following occurs:

(a)

further inspections or tests are required;

(b)

any information on the EU type-approval certificate, with the exception of its attachments, has changed;

(c)

new requirements under any act listed in Annex I become applicable to the approved vehicle type or to the approved system, component or separate technical unit.

In the event of an extension, the approval authority shall issue an updated EU type-approval certificate denoted by an extension number, incremented in accordance with the number of successive extensions already granted. That approval certificate shall clearly show the reason for the extension and the date of reissue.

3.   Whenever amended pages or a consolidated, updated version are issued, the index to the information package attached to the approval certificate shall be amended accordingly to show the date of the most recent extension or revision, or the date of the most recent consolidation of the updated version.

4.   No amendment to the type-approval of a vehicle shall be required if the new requirements referred to in point (c) of paragraph 2 are, from a technical point of view, irrelevant to that type of vehicle or concern categories of vehicle other than the category to which it belongs.

Article 31

Issue and notification of amendments

1.   In the case of an extension all relevant sections of the EU type-approval certificate, the attachments thereto, and the index to the information package shall be updated. The updated certificate and its attachments shall be issued to the applicant without delay.

Such a certificate shall be delivered free of charge to the buyer together with the vehicle. Its delivery may not be made dependent on an explicit request or the submission of additional information to the manufacturer.

For a period of 10 years after the production date of the vehicle, the vehicle manufacturer shall, at the request of the vehicle owner, issue a duplicate of the certificate of conformity against a payment not exceeding the cost of issuing it. The word ‘duplicate’ shall be clearly visible on the face of any duplicate certificate.

2.   The manufacturer shall use the template for the certificate of conformity adopted by the Commission by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 69(2). The certificate of conformity shall be designed to prevent forgery. To that end, the implementing acts shall provide that the paper used in the certificate shall be protected by several security printing features. The first such implementing acts shall be adopted by 31 December 2014.

3.   The certificate of conformity shall be drawn up in at least one of the official languages of the Union. Any Member State may request the certificate of conformity to be translated into its own official language or languages.

4.   The person(s) authorised to sign certificates of conformity shall be in the manufacturer’s organisation and shall be duly authorised by the management to fully engage the legal responsibility of the manufacturer with respect to the design and the construction or to the conformity of the production of the vehicle.

5.   The certificate of conformity shall be completed in its entirety and shall not contain restrictions as regards the use of the vehicle other than those provided for in this Regulation or any of the delegated acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation.

6.   In the case of an incomplete or completed vehicle, the manufacturer shall fill in only those items of the certificate of conformity which have been added or changed at the current stage of approval and, if applicable, shall attach to the certificate all certificates of conformity delivered at the previous stages.

7.   The certificate of conformity shall, for vehicles approved in accordance with Article 35(2), display in its title the phrase ‘For complete/completed vehicles, type-approved in application of Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 February 2013 on the approval and market surveillance of agricultural and forestry vehicles (provisional approval)’.

8.   The certificate of conformity as set out in the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 2, shall, for vehicles type-approved in accordance with Article 37, display in the title thereof the phrase ‘For complete/completed vehicles type-approved in small series’, and in close proximity thereto the year of production followed by a sequential number, between 1 and the limit indicated in the table set out in Annex II, denoting, in respect of each year of production, the position of that vehicle within the production allocated for that year.

3.   The statutory plate and EU type-approval mark shall be in accordance with the model set out by the Commission by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 69(2). The first such implementing acts shall be adopted by 31 December 2014.

CHAPTER IX

EXEMPTIONS FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR NEW CONCEPTS

Article 35

Exemptions for new technologies or new concepts

1.   The manufacturer may apply for an EU type-approval in respect of a type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit that incorporates new technologies or concepts which are incompatible with one or more acts listed in Annex I.

2.   The approval authority shall grant the EU type-approval referred to in paragraph 1 where all of the following conditions are met:

(a)

the application states the reasons why the technologies or concepts in question make the system, component or separate technical unit incompatible with one or more acts listed in Annex I;

(b)

the application describes the safety and environmental implications of the new technology and the measures taken in order to ensure at least an equivalent level of safety and environmental protection as that provided by the requirements from which exemption is sought;

(c)

test descriptions and results are presented which prove that the condition in point (b) is met.

3.   The granting of such an EU type-approval exempting new technologies or new concepts shall be subject to authorisation by the Commission. That authorisation shall be given by means of an implementing act. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 69(2).

4.   Pending the decision on authorisation by the Commission, the approval authority may already issue the EU type-approval, but it shall be provisional, valid only in the territory of that Member State, in respect of a type of vehicle covered by the exemption sought. The approval authority shall inform the Commission and the other Member States thereof without delay by means of a file containing the information referred to in paragraph 2.

The provisional nature and the limited territorial validity shall be apparent from the heading of the type-approval certificate and the heading of the certificate of conformity. The Commission may adopt implementing acts in order to provide for harmonised templates for the type-approval certificate and the certificate of conformity for the purposes of this paragraph. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 69(2).

5.   Other approval authorities may decide to accept in writing the provisional approval referred to in paragraph 4 within their territory.

6.   Where appropriate, the authorisation by the Commission referred to in paragraph 3 shall also specify whether it is subject to any restrictions. In all cases, the type-approval shall be valid for at least 36 months.

7.   If the Commission decides to refuse authorisation, the approval authority shall immediately give notice to the holder of the provisional type-approval referred to in paragraph 3 that the provisional approval will be revoked six months after the date of the Commission’s refusal.

However, vehicles manufactured in conformity with the provisional approval before it ceases to be valid may be placed on the market, registered or entered into service in any Member State that accepted the provisional approval.

Article 36

Subsequent adaptation of delegated and implementing acts

1.   Where the Commission authorises the granting of an exemption pursuant to Article 35, it shall immediately take the necessary steps to adapt the delegated or implementing acts concerned to technological developments.

Where the exemption under Article 35 relates to a UNECE regulation, the Commission shall propose an amendment to the relevant UNECE regulation in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Revised 1958 Agreement.

2.   As soon as the relevant acts have been amended, any restriction in the Commission decision authorising the exemption shall be lifted.

If the necessary steps to adapt the delegated or implementing acts have not been taken, the Commission may, at the request of the Member State which granted the approval, authorise, by means of a decision in the form of an implementing act adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 69(2), the Member State to extend the type-approval.

CHAPTER X

VEHICLES PRODUCED IN SMALL SERIES

Article 37

National type-approval of small series

1.   The manufacturer may apply for a national type-approval of small series of a type of vehicle within the quantitative annual limits set out in Annex II. These limits shall apply to the making available on the market, registration or entry into service of vehicles of the approved type on the market of each Member State in a given year.

For the national type-approval of small series, the approval authority may, if it has reasonable grounds to do so, waive one or more of the provisions of this Regulation and one or more of the provisions of one or more of the acts listed in Annex I, provided that it specifies alternative requirements.

2.   The alternative requirements referred to in paragraph 1 shall ensure a level of functional safety and environmental protection and occupational safety which is equivalent to the greatest extent practicable to the level provided for by the relevant acts listed in Annex I.

3.   For the national type-approval of vehicles under this Article, systems, components or separate technical units which are type-approved in accordance with the acts listed in Annex I shall be accepted.

4.   The type-approval certificate for vehicles type-approved in accordance with this Article shall be drafted in accordance with the template referred to in Article 25(2), but shall not bear the heading ‘EU vehicle type-approval certificate’ and shall specify the content of the waivers granted pursuant to paragraph 1. Type-approval certificates shall be numbered in accordance with the harmonised system referred to in Article 24(4).

5.   The validity of a national type-approval of small series shall be restricted to the territory of the Member State whose approval authority granted the approval.

6.   However, at the request of the manufacturer, a copy of the type-approval certificate and its attachments shall be sent by registered mail or by electronic mail to the approval authorities of the Member States designated by the manufacturer.

7.   Within three months of receipt of the request referred to in paragraph 6, the approval authorities of the Member States designated by the manufacturer shall decide whether or not they accept the type-approval. They shall formally communicate their decision to the approval authority which granted the national type-approval of small series.

8.   The approval authorities of the Member States shall accept the national type-approval unless they have reasonable grounds to believe that the national technical requirements in accordance with which the vehicle was approved are not equivalent to their own.

9.   At the request of an applicant who wishes to place on the market or register a vehicle with national type-approval of small series in another Member State, the approval authority that granted the national type-approval of small series shall provide the national authority of the other Member State with a copy of the type-approval certificate including the information package. Paragraphs 7 and 8 shall apply.

1.   Where the market surveillance authorities of one Member State have taken action pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, or where they have sufficient reason to believe that a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit covered by this Regulation presents a serious risk to the health or safety of persons or to other aspects of the protection of public interests covered by this Regulation, the approval authority that granted the approval shall carry out an evaluation in relation to the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned covering all the requirements laid down in this Regulation. The relevant economic operators shall cooperate fully with the approval and/or market surveillance authorities.

Where, in the course of that evaluation, the approval authority that granted the approval finds that the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, it shall without delay require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate corrective action to bring the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit into compliance with those requirements, to withdraw the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit from the market, or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk.

Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 shall apply to the measures referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph.

2.   Where the approval authorities consider that non-conformity is not restricted to their national territory, they shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and the action required of the economic operator.

3.   The economic operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all non-compliant vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units that it has placed on the market, registered or is responsible for its entry into service in the Union.

4.   Where the economic operator does not take adequate corrective action within the period referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, the national authorities shall take all appropriate measures to prohibit or restrict the making available on the market, registration or entry into service of non-compliant vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units on their national market, to withdraw them from that market or to recall them.

5.   The national authorities shall, without delay, inform the Commission and the other Member States of the measures provided for in paragraph 4.

The information provided shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit, its origin, the nature of the non-conformity alleged and the risk involved, the nature and duration of the national measures taken, and the arguments put forward by the relevant economic operator. In particular, the approval authorities shall indicate whether the non-conformity is due to either of the following:

(a)

failure of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit to meet requirements relating to the health or safety of persons, the protection of the environment or to other aspects of the protection of public interests covered by this Regulation;

(b)

shortcomings in the relevant acts listed in Annex I.

6.   Member States shall within one month inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-conformity of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the notified national measure, of their objections.

7.   Where, within one month of receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article, an objection has been raised by either another Member State or the Commission in respect of a measure taken by a Member State, that measure shall be evaluated by the Commission in accordance with Article 42.

8.   Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures are taken in respect of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned, such as withdrawal of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit from their market, without delay.

Article 42

Union safeguard procedure

1.   Where, during the procedure set out in Article 41(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State, or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to the Union legislation, the Commission shall without delay evaluate the national measure after consulting Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide, in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 69(2), whether the national measure is considered justified or not.

The Commission shall communicate its decision to all Member States and to the relevant economic operator or operators.

2.   If the national measure is considered justified by the Commission, all Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the non-compliant vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw or adapt the measure, in accordance with the decision referred to in paragraph 1.

3.   Where the national measure is considered justified and is attributed to shortcomings in this Regulation or in delegated or implementing acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation, the Commission shall propose appropriate measures as follows:

(a)

where delegated or implementing acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation are concerned, the Commission shall propose the necessary amendments to the act concerned;

(b)

where UNECE regulations are concerned, the Commission shall propose the necessary draft amendments to the relevant UNECE regulations in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Revised 1958 Agreement.

Article 43

Compliant vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units that present a serious risk

1.   Where, having performed an evaluation under Article 41(1), a Member State finds that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units, although they comply with the applicable requirements or are properly marked, present a serious risk to safety or may seriously harm the environment or public health, it shall require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned, when placed on the market, registered or after its entry into service, no longer presents that risk, to withdraw the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit from the market or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk. The Member State may refuse to register such vehicles until the vehicle manufacturer has taken all appropriate measures.

2.   For a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit as referred to in paragraph 1, the economic operator shall ensure that corrective action is taken in respect of all such vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units placed on the market, registered or entered into service in the Union.

3.   The Member State referred to in paragraph 1 shall within one month inform the Commission and the other Member States of all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned, the origin and the supply chain of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken.

4.   The Commission shall, without delay, consult the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and, in particular, the approval authority that granted the type-approval, and shall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the national measures referred to in paragraph 1 are considered justified or not and, where necessary, propose appropriate measures.

5.   The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators.

Article 44

Vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units not in conformity with the approved type

1.   Where new vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units accompanied by a certificate of conformity or bearing an approval mark do not conform to the approved type, the approval authority which granted the EU type-approval shall take the necessary measures, including the withdrawal of type-approval, to ensure that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units in production are brought into conformity with the approved type.

2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, deviations from the particulars in the EU type-approval certificate or the information package shall be deemed to constitute failure to conform to the approved type.

3.   If an approval authority demonstrates that new vehicles, components or separate technical units accompanied by a certificate of conformity or bearing an approval mark issued in another Member State do not conform to the approved type, it may ask the approval authority which granted the EU type-approval to verify that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units in production continue to conform to the approved type. On receipt of such a request, the approval authority which granted the EU type-approval shall take the requisite action as soon as possible and at the latest within three months of the date of the request.

4.   The approval authority shall request the approval authority which granted the EU type-approval for a system, component, separate technical unit or incomplete vehicle to take the necessary action to ensure that vehicles in production are brought back into conformity with the approved type in the following cases:

(a)

for an EU vehicle type-approval, where the non-conformity of a vehicle is attributable exclusively to the non-conformity of a system, component or separate technical unit;

(b)

for a multi-stage type-approval, where the non-conformity of a completed vehicle is attributable exclusively to the non-conformity of a system, component or separate technical unit that forms part of the incomplete vehicle or to the non-conformity of the incomplete vehicle itself.

5.   On receipt of such a request, the approval authority concerned shall take the necessary action, if necessary in conjunction with the approval authority making the request, as soon as possible and at the latest within three months of the date of the request.

6.   Where non-conformity is established, the approval authority of the Member State that granted the EU type-approval for the system, component or separate technical unit or for the incomplete vehicle shall take the measures set out in paragraph 1.

The approval authorities shall inform each other within one month of any withdrawal of EU type-approval and of the reasons therefor.

7.   If the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval disputes the non-conformity notified to it, the Member States concerned shall endeavour to settle the dispute. The Commission shall be kept informed and, where necessary, shall hold appropriate consultations with a view to reaching a settlement.

Article 45

Placing on the market and entry into service of parts or equipment that may pose a serious risk to the correct functioning of essential systems

1.   Parts or equipment that may pose a serious risk to the correct functioning of systems that are essential for the safety of the vehicle or for its environmental performance shall not be placed on the market, registered or enter into service and shall be prohibited, unless they have been authorised by an approval authority in accordance with Article 46(1), (2) and (4).

2.   In order to ensure the uniform application of paragraph 1, the Commission may adopt implementing acts to draw up a list of such parts or equipment on the basis of available information, and in particular information communicated by the Member States regarding:

(a)

the seriousness of the risk to the safety or environmental performance of vehicles fitted with the parts or equipment in question;

(b)

the possible effect on consumers and after-market manufacturers of the imposition under this Article of a possible authorisation requirement for parts or equipment.

1.   Where a manufacturer who has been granted an EU whole-vehicle type-approval is obliged, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, to recall vehicles placed on the market, registered or for which the manufacturer was responsible for the entry into service, because a system, component or separate technical unit fitted to the vehicle presents a serious risk to safety, public health or environmental protection, whether or not duly approved in accordance with this Regulation, or because a part not subject to any specific requirements under type-approval legislation presents a serious risk to safety, public health or environmental protection, that manufacturer shall immediately inform the approval authority that granted the vehicle approval.

2.   Where a manufacturer of systems, components or separate technical units, who has been granted an EU type-approval is obliged, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, to recall systems, components or separate technical units which have been placed on the market or for which the manufacturer was responsible for the entry into service, because they present a serious risk to safety, occupational safety, public health or environmental protection, whether or not duly approved in accordance with this Regulation, the manufacturer shall immediately inform the approval authority that granted the approval.

3.   The manufacturer shall propose to the approval authority a set of appropriate remedies to neutralise the serious risk referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. The approval authority shall communicate the proposed remedies to the approval authorities of the other Member States without delay.

The approval authorities shall ensure that the remedies are effectively implemented in their respective Member States.

4.   If the remedies are considered to be insufficient or not implemented quickly enough by the approval authority concerned, it shall inform the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval without delay.

The approval authority that granted the EU type-approval shall then inform the manufacturer. If the manufacturer does not propose and implement effective corrective measures, the approval authority which granted the EU type-approval shall take all protective measures required, including the withdrawal of the EU type-approval. In the case of withdrawal of the EU type-approval, the approval authority shall within one month of such withdrawal notify the manufacturer, the approval authorities of the other Member States and the Commission by registered letter or equivalent electronic means.

Article 48

Notification of decisions and remedies available

1.   All decisions taken pursuant to this Regulation and all decisions refusing or withdrawing EU type-approval, or refusing registration, prohibiting or restricting the placing on the market, registration or entry into service of a vehicle or requiring withdrawal of a vehicle from the market, shall state in detail the reasons on which they are based.

2.   Any such decision shall be notified to the party concerned who shall, at the same time, be informed of the remedies available to it under the laws in force in the Member State concerned and of the time limits allowed for the exercise of such remedies.

Article 60

Accredited in-house technical services of the manufacturer

1.   An accredited in-house technical service of a manufacturer may be designated only for category A activities with regard to technical requirements for which self-testing is allowed by a delegated act adopted pursuant to this Regulation. That technical service shall constitute a separate and distinct part of the undertaking and shall not be involved in the design, manufacturing, supply or maintenance of the vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units it assesses.

2.   An accredited in-house technical service shall meet the following requirements:

(a)

in addition to being designated by the approval authority of a Member State it shall be accredited by a national accreditation body as defined in point 11 of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 and in accordance with the standards and procedure referred to in Article 61 of this Regulation;

(b)

the accredited in-house technical service and its personnel shall be organisationally identifiable and have reporting methods within the undertaking of which they form part which ensure their impartiality and demonstrate it to the relevant national accreditation body;

(c)

neither the accredited in-house technical service nor its personnel shall engage in any activity that might conflict with their independence of judgment or integrity in relation to the categories of activities for which they have been designated;

(d)

the accredited in-house technical service shall supply its services exclusively to the undertaking of which it forms part.

3.   An accredited in-house technical service need not be notified to the Commission for the purposes of Article 63, but information concerning its accreditation shall be given by the undertaking of which it forms part or by the national accreditation body to the designating approval authority at the request of that authority.

Article 61

Procedures for performance standards and assessment of technical services

In order to ensure that technical services meet the same high level of performance standards in all Member States, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 71 concerning the standards with which the technical services have to comply and the procedure for their assessment in accordance with Article 62 and their accreditation in accordance with Article 60.

Article 62

Assessment of the skills of the technical services

1.   The designating approval authority shall draw up an assessment report demonstrating that the candidate technical service has been assessed for its compliance with the requirements of this Regulation and the delegated acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation. That report may include a certificate of accreditation issued by an accreditation body.

2.   The assessment on which the report referred to in paragraph 1 is based shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions laid down in a delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 61. The assessment report shall be reviewed at least every three years.

3.   The assessment report shall be communicated to the Commission upon request. In such cases, where the assessment is not based on an accreditation certificate issued by a national accreditation body attesting that the technical service fulfils the requirements of this Regulation, the designating approval authority shall provide the Commission with documentary evidence which attests the technical service’s competence and the arrangements in place to ensure that the technical service is monitored regularly by the designating approval authority and satisfies the requirements of this Regulation and the delegated acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation.

4.   The approval authority that intends to be designated as a technical service in accordance with Article 59(2) shall document compliance through an assessment conducted by auditors independent of the activity being assessed. Such auditors may be from the same organisation provided that they are managed separately from personnel undertaking the assessed activity.

5.   An accredited in-house technical service shall comply with the relevant provisions of this Article.

Article 63

Procedures for notification

1.   Member States shall notify to the Commission the name, the address including electronic address, the responsible persons and the category of activities with respect to each technical service they have designated, as well as any subsequent modifications to those designations. The notification act shall state for which subjects listed in Annex I the technical services have been designated.

2.   A technical service may conduct the activities referred to in Article 59(1) on behalf of the designating approval authority responsible for the type-approval only if it has been notified beforehand to the Commission in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article.

3.   The same technical service may be designated by several designating approval authorities and notified by the Member States of these designating approval authorities irrespective of the category or categories of activities it will conduct in accordance with Article 59(1).

4.   The Commission shall be notified of any subsequent relevant changes to the designation.

5.   Where a specific organisation or competent body carrying out an activity not included in those referred to in Article 59(1), needs to be designated in application of an act listed in Annex I, the notification shall be made in accordance with this Article.

6.   The Commission shall publish on its website a list and details of the technical services notified in accordance with this Article.

Article 64

Changes to designations

1.   Where a designating approval authority has ascertained or has been informed that a technical service designated by it no longer meets the requirements laid down in this Regulation, or that it is failing to fulfil its obligations, the designating approval authority shall restrict, suspend or withdraw the designation as appropriate, depending on the seriousness of the failure to meet those requirements or fulfil those obligations. The Member State that has notified this technical service shall immediately inform the Commission accordingly. The Commission shall modify the information published referred to in Article 63(6) accordingly.

2.   In the event of restriction, suspension or withdrawal of the designation, or where the technical service has ceased its activity, the designating approval authority shall take appropriate steps to ensure that the files of that technical service are either processed by another technical service or kept available for the designating approval authority or for the market surveillance authorities at their request.

Article 65

Challenge to the competence of technical services

1.   The Commission shall investigate all cases where it has doubts, or doubt is brought to its attention, regarding the competence of a technical service or the continued fulfilment by a technical service of the requirements and responsibilities to which it is subject.

2.   The Member State of the designating approval authority shall provide the Commission, on request, with all information relating to the basis for the designation or the maintenance of the designation of the technical service concerned.

3.   The Commission shall ensure that all sensitive information obtained in the course of its investigations is treated confidentially.

4.   Where the Commission ascertains that a technical service does not meet or no longer meets the requirements for its designation, it shall inform the Member State of the designating approval authority accordingly, with a view to establishing, in cooperation with that Member State, the corrective measures necessary, and shall request that Member State to take those corrective measures, including the withdrawal of the designation if necessary.

Article 66

Operational obligations of technical services

1.   Technical services shall carry out the categories of activities for which they have been designated on behalf of the designating approval authority and in accordance with the assessment and test procedures provided for in this Regulation and the acts listed in Annex I.

Technical services shall supervise or shall themselves carry out the tests required for approval or inspections as set out in this Regulation or in one of the acts listed in Annex I, except where alternative procedures are permitted. The technical services shall not conduct tests, assessments or inspections for which they have not been duly designated by their approval authority.

2.   Technical services shall at all times:

(a)

allow their designating approval authority to witness the technical service during the conformity assessment as appropriate; and

(b)

without prejudice to Article 57(9) and Article 67, provide their designating approval authority such information on their categories of activities falling under the scope of this Regulation as may be requested.

3.   Where a technical service finds that requirements laid down in this Regulation have not been met by a manufacturer, it shall report this to the designating approval authority with a view for the designating approval authority requiring the manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures and subsequently not to issue a type-approval certificate unless the appropriate corrective measures have been taken to the satisfaction of the approval authority.

4.   Where, in the course of monitoring conformity of production following the issue of a type-approval certificate, a technical service acting on behalf of the designating approval authority finds that a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit no longer complies with this Regulation, it shall report this to the designating approval authority. The approval authority shall take the appropriate measures as provided for in Article 28.

Article 67

Information obligations of technical services

1.   Technical services shall inform their designating approval authority of the following:

(a)

any non-conformity encountered which may require a refusal, restriction, suspension or withdrawal of a type-approval certificate;

(b)

any circumstances affecting the scope of and conditions for their designation;

(c)

any request for information which they have received from market surveillance authorities regarding their activities.

2.   On request from their designating approval authority, technical services shall provide information on the activities within the scope of their designation and on any other activity performed, including cross-border activities and subcontracting.
