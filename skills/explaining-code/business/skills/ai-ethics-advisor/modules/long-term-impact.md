# Long-Term Impact Assessment

Analysis of societal-scale effects, feedback loops, and intergenerational considerations.

## Temporal Scales of Impact

| Timeframe | Focus | Examples |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Immediate | Direct effects | Individual decisions affected |
| Short-term (1-2 years) | Adoption effects | Behavior changes, market shifts |
| Medium-term (3-5 years) | Systemic effects | Industry transformation, skill shifts |
| Long-term (5-20 years) | Societal effects | Social structure changes, norm shifts |
| Generational (20+ years) | Civilization effects | Fundamental capability changes |

## Feedback Loop Analysis

### Types of Feedback Loops

**Reinforcing Loops (Amplification)**
- Predictions influence behavior that confirms predictions
- Example: Hiring AI predicts who will succeed → trains on who was hired → reinforces initial biases

**Balancing Loops (Stabilization)**
- System changes trigger corrective responses
- Example: Bias detection triggers retraining → reduces bias → less frequent corrections

### Common AI Feedback Loops

| Loop Type | Description | Risk | Mitigation |
|-----------|-------------|------|------------|
| Performative prediction | Predictions change reality | Self-fulfilling prophecy | Monitor outcome distributions |
| Data collection | Decisions affect future data | Bias amplification | Representative sampling |
| Behavioral | Users adapt to system | Gaming, deskilling | Evolve system, preserve skills |
| Market | Market share affects resources | Winner-take-all | Interoperability, antitrust |
| Political | AI affects political power | Democratic erosion | Governance structures |

### Feedback Loop Assessment
1. What predictions/decisions does this system make?
2. How might those affect future data/behavior?
3. Could this create self-reinforcing cycles?
4. What monitoring would detect problematic loops?

## Systemic Risk Analysis

### Concentration Risks
- Market concentration (few dominant providers)
- Data concentration (who has the data)
- Compute concentration (who can train large models)
- Talent concentration (where expertise resides)

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- Single points of failure
- Supply chain vulnerabilities
- Cloud provider dependency
- Critical systems reliance

### Cascading Failure Scenarios
Consider how failure in one system could cascade:
- Financial systems
- Critical infrastructure
- Information ecosystem
- Social systems

## Labor Market Effects

### Displacement Analysis
| Affected Role | Displacement Timeline | Transition Path |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| [Role 1] | [Short/Medium/Long] | [Options] |
| [Role 2] | | |

### Skill Implications
- What skills become less valuable?
- What skills become more valuable?
- What new skills are needed?
- Who has access to reskilling?

### Economic Distribution
- How are gains distributed?
- Who bears transition costs?
- What happens to displaced workers?
- What about geographic concentration?

## Social and Political Effects

### Social Cohesion
- Effect on trust
- Effect on shared understanding
- Effect on community bonds
- Effect on social mobility

### Democratic Implications
- Effect on political participation
- Effect on information quality
- Effect on power distribution
- Effect on civil liberties

### Autonomy and Agency
- Effect on individual choice
- Effect on self-determination
- Effect on human capabilities
- Effect on meaningful work

## Intergenerational Considerations

### What We Leave Behind
- Technical debt and lock-in
- Training data biases baked in
- Precedents set for acceptable use
- Environmental impact

### Future Generations
- Will they be able to understand our systems?
- Can they modify or reject them?
- What irreversible choices are we making?
- What options are we foreclosing?

### Sustainability
- Energy and resource use
- Environmental impact
- Economic sustainability
- Social sustainability

## Scenario Planning

### Scenario Development Framework

**Best Case**: How could this go very well?
- What positive outcomes are possible?
- What would enable them?
- How can we increase this likelihood?

**Base Case**: What's the expected outcome?
- Most likely trajectory
- Key assumptions
- Monitoring indicators

**Worst Case**: How could this go badly?
- What negative outcomes are possible?
- What would cause them?
- How can we prevent or mitigate?

**Wild Card**: What unexpected developments are possible?
- Unforeseen uses or consequences
- Interaction with other trends
- Black swan events

## Long-Term Governance

### Adaptive Governance
- Regular reassessment triggers
- Sunset clauses
- Version control for policies
- Flexibility for unknown unknowns

### Institutional Memory
- Documentation for future operators
- Decision rationale preserved
- Lessons learned captured
- Knowledge transfer processes

### Accountability Over Time
- Who is accountable in 10 years?
- How are long-term harms addressed?
- What recourse for future generations?

## Assessment Framework

### Long-Term Impact Checklist
- [ ] Feedback loops identified and monitored
- [ ] Systemic risks assessed
- [ ] Labor market effects considered
- [ ] Social implications analyzed
- [ ] Intergenerational effects considered
- [ ] Scenario planning conducted
- [ ] Adaptive governance in place

### Key Questions
1. What could this look like at 10x scale?
2. What feedback loops could emerge?
3. Who wins and loses over time?
4. What irreversible changes could occur?
5. How will we know if we were wrong?
